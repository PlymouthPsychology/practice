#### Q: How do I know which practice tasks to complete?

Practice tasks are self-paced and can be completed in any order. Staff may recommend specific tasks when they relate to current lecture or workshop content. You can browse all tasks by [category](tasks.html) or explore specific themes using the menu.

#### Q: Can I get help with practice tasks?

Yes! All staff offer office hours where you can discuss your practice work. You can also upload completed tasks to [PsyBot](psybot.html) for immediate AI feedback, or visit staff during their scheduled office hours for more detailed support.


#### Q: Are the practice tasks compulsory?

The practice tasks are an integral part of your degree. Skipping them won't cause you to fail a specific module, but

-   the tasks are focused on the core skills required to do well in the course.

-   tutors will become concerned if you are not enaged with this important component of the course

-   your ability to practice regularly and reflect and act on feedback is a good indicator of your ability as a student. In stage 3, this information may be used to inform decisions about placements, and in stage 4 potential supervisors will use this information as part of their decision about which students to accept onto their research projects

-   completing practice tasks and engaging with feedback shows your commitment to learning, which tutors value when writing job references or academic references for further study.
