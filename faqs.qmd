#### Q: Are the practice tasks compulsory?

The practice tasks are an integral part of your degree. Skipping them won't cause you to fail a specific module, but

-   the knowledge and experience you gain through practice will be expected by your lecturers. You you may find later material hard if you do not complete them.

-   the tasks are focused on the core skills required to do well in the course.

-   tutors will become concerned if you are not enaged with this important component of the course

-   your ability to practice regularly and reflect and act on feedback is a good indicator of your ability as a student. In stage 3, this information may be used to inform decisions about placements, and in stage 4 potential supervisors will use this information as part of their decision about which students to accept onto their research projects

-   practice tasks and progress meetings are the main ways your tutor can get to know you, and will greatly help them when writing a job reference, or academic reference for further study ([see why this matters](how-we-write-references.html))
