#### When are the weekly briefings?

Mondays at 10am. [See the zoom link here](https://dle.plymouth.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=1840804&forceview=1).





#### Q: What should we discuss in my progress meetings?

It's up to you! However we would suggest topics like:

- reviewing the practice tasks from this site, and other work you have submitted
- questions about your understanding of the course material
- preparation for assessment and revision
- career planning and plans for further study
- any concerns you have about the course
- any feedback you have about the course


#### Q: Are the practice tasks compulsory?

The practice tasks are an integral part of your degree. Skipping them won't cause you to fail a specific module, but

-   the knowledge and experience you gain through practice will be expected by your lecturers. You you may find later material hard if you do not complete them.

-   the tasks are focused on the core skills required to do well in the course.

-   tutors will become concerned if you are not enaged with this important component of the course

-   your ability to practice regularly and reflect and act on feedback is a good indicator of your ability as a student. In stage 3, this information may be used to inform decisions about placements, and in stage 4 potential supervisors will use this information as part of their decision about which students to accept onto their research projects

-   practice tasks and progress meetings are the main ways your tutor can get to know you, and will greatly help them when writing a job reference, or academic reference for further study.
