# PSYC421 Practical Report – Marking/Feedback Checklist for LLM

The student’s task was to write a practical report (Intro, Method, Results, Discussion, References) on the recognition memory experiment (brief vs long study duration). Use the checklist below to decide whether required elements are present and correct. For each missing or incomplete element, give constructive feedback.


# BACKGROUND ON THE ASSIGNMENT

## PSYC421 Practical Report Frequently Asked Questions

[THESE WERE FAQS GIVEN TO STUDENTS TO GUIDE THEIR ANSWERS]

--------

Can I find my own sources and journal articles for the Introduction etc.?
Yes, you can. Key references were provided in Lecture 9, but you can also conduct your own research on the topic by using the literature searching tools you’ve been taught on the course already (e.g. Google Scholar in Research Methods, Lecture 1); this is strongly encouraged and is good academic practice.

In the Method, do we report the demographic details (e.g., mean age etc.) of the whole dataset that you gave us in Lecture 9?
Yes, include the demographic details I gave for the whole dataset. You also need to give the number of participants in each condition in your dataset. The good report example on the DLE has a good example of this.

What is the research question and hypothesis for the experiment?
Use the information on Slide 15 of Lecture 9 (Practical Overview) to help you formulate either the specific research question or hypothesis.

Do we create our own title that we think is most appropriate for our report?
Yes, please create a title that you think is most appropriate for your report. To help, compare the titles in Good and Poor example reports.

What should you report if both homogeneity of variance AND normality is violated for your independent samples test?
If the normality assumption is violated then Mann Whitney should be used. This is because the Welch’s t test still assumes normality, so shouldn’t be used if this assumption has been violated. See also Lecture 7, slide 20, and jamovi genius.

Did we test long-term or short-term memory in the experiment?
Long-term memory. This is defined as memory that persists for more than seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks or years. This is in contrast to short-term or working memory, which is the type of memory you might use to keep a phone number in your head if someone read it out to you, and does not last as long. The experiment had a 5-minute retention interval (the word fragment completion game) to ensure long-term memory was being tested.

Do we report the demographic details you gave us in Lecture 9?
Yes, report these demographic details for the whole dataset in the Participants section of the Methods. Then include a sentence at the end of this section where you say how many participants you had in each condition of your unique dataset. There is a good example of how to do this in the good-excellent report example.

Do we write up the report as if we had conducted the experiment ourselves?
Yes, although you can use the passive voice if you prefer (e.g., “There were two conditions”, rather than “We had two conditions”).

How many references are we meant to include?
There’s no fixed number to include. Remember that everything you cite (e.g., in the Introduction) should be referenced in the References section. Most reports will probably have a reference list in length somewhere between that of the good and poor example reports.

I’m reporting median values in my results because my data violated the normality assumption. Should I report the median and IQR on my Excel bar chart too?
This is not necessary for this report. You only need to produce a bar chart with the mean and SE shown in each condition, and won’t be penalised if you do this but have reported a non-parametric test (because normality was violated). This is because it more straightforward for the error bars in Excel to represent the SE than the IQR. The IQR value jamovi gives you is the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles of data, and so if this value were to be used to create error bars, the total width of the error bars would be much greater than what we actually want to represent. What we’d actually want to represent on each bar is the difference between the 50th percentile (median) and the 25th and 75th percentile, for the height below and above the bar, respectively. Plotting this is beyond the scope of what you are expected to do in this report, so it is fine if your bar chart simply shows the mean and SE of each condition.

How do you interpret the rank biserial correlation in terms of effect size?
You can use Cohen’s (1992) guidelines for interpreting the absolute value of a correlation:
Small effect	r = 0.20
Medium effect	r = 0.30
Large effect	r = 0.50

Cohen, J. (1992). A power primer. Psychological Bulletin, 112(1), 155-159. https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.112.1.155 

How can I reference jamovi?
As follows:
The jamovi project (2024). jamovi (Version 2.5) [Computer Software]. Retrieved from https://www.jamovi.org 


Can I use the information in Lecture 9 to write the report? If so, how do I reference it?
Yes, the expectation is that you’d use the information in Lecture 9 to help write your report. The reference for each source cited in the lecture is provided on the slide headed “References” towards the end of the slides. The other information (e.g., details of the experiment procedures, its timings, etc.) can be provided without citing Lecture 9 itself. The good-excellent report example demonstrates a good style of writing when information has been provided to the person writing the report under similar circumstances.

Do we need to summarise the briefing process in the Method?
For this report it is sufficient to say that participants were briefed and then gave consent to take part. You don’t need to say more than that to describe the initial briefing process, but if you want more information, the brief of this experiment informed participants that they would take part in an experiment designed to investigate cognitive processes and would involve making decisions to simple everyday objects and their memory for them would later be tested. Full instructions were given in each phase.


How do we interpret and write up the results of two sample t-tests or Mann Whitney U tests?
For examples, please look at the answer sheet for Worksheet 7 where these tests were covered. Lecture 7 should also be consulted.


# SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS TO CHECK THE STUDENT'S WORK THIS YEAR

* The student must state their **unique dataset ID** (e.g. a number like `<00000>`, but unique to them) in the report.
* They must have uploaded their dataset file with the report (the marker checks this separately, but the report should mention it).

### Introduction

The Introduction should:

* Clearly state the **research question**: whether recognition memory accuracy differs between brief (250 ms) and long (2000 ms) exposure durations.
* Provide **rationale and background** with reference to previous research:

  * Tversky & Sherman (1975): longer exposure improves picture memory.
  * von Hippel & Hawkins (1994): exposure duration affects word memory.
  * Spence et al. (2006): exposure duration improves scene memory.
  * Berry et al. (2017): object stimuli and study duration effects.
* Mention **broader implications**: advertising, education, eyewitness testimony.
* End with a **clear hypothesis**: recognition memory accuracy will be higher for items studied for longer durations.

Feedback rule: If the Introduction does not mention past studies, lacks a hypothesis, or doesn’t state the research question clearly, point this out.


### Method

The Method should include:

**Participants**

* Approx. 200 psychology undergraduates in original experiment.
* Subset analysed by each student (they must report actual *n* for each condition from their dataset).
* State demographics if included (e.g. mean age ~19 years, report the gender split from slides).

**Design**

* Between-subjects design with 2 conditions (brief vs long exposure).
* IV: study duration (250 ms vs 2000 ms).
* DV: recognition accuracy (% correct).

**Materials**

* 240 colour images of objects (ObScene database, Andrade et al. 2023).
* Half studied, half non-studied.

**Procedure**

* Study phase: participants judged whether each object was smaller/larger than a shoebox. Exposure: 250 ms (brief) or 2000 ms (long).
* Retention interval: 5 minutes.
* Test phase: recognition test of 240 items (120 studied, 120 new). Response: “old/new”.
* DV calculated as: percent correct = (number of correct decisions / 240) × 100.

Feedback rule: If Method omits design, IV/DV, or doesn’t specify what was done in each condition, note this.

---

### Results


Note: students each analysed a subset of the data, so the results will vary slightly from the total dataset and between students.


However, the Results must include:

**Descriptive Statistics**

* Report the number of participants in each condition (from dataset).
* Report correct central tendency & dispersion:

  * If Student’s/Welch’s t used → mean and SD for each condition.
  * If Mann-Whitney U used → median and IQR.
* Clearly present condition labels (“brief” vs “long”).

**Inferential Statistics**

* Report outcome of assumption checks:

  * Normality test.
  * Homogeneity of variance test.
* Choose correct test:

  * If assumptions met → independent samples Student’s t.
  * If variance violated → Welch’s t.
  * If normality violated → Mann-Whitney U.
* Report test statistic with correct details:

  * t(df) = value, p = value (for t-tests).
  * U = value, p = value (for Mann-Whitney).
* Report effect size (e.g., Cohen’s d for t-tests).

**Figure**

* Bar chart showing recognition accuracy by condition.
* Bars labelled (brief vs long).
* Y-axis labelled “% correct”.
* Error bars = standard error of mean (SE).
* Caption/figure number included.

Feedback rule: If test not reported properly (e.g., missing df, p-value, or incorrect descriptive stats for test type), or if figure lacks error bars/labels, point it out.

---

### Discussion

The Discussion should:

* Restate **main findings**: whether recognition accuracy differed between conditions, which was higher.
* State whether findings **support the hypothesis**.
* Link back to **previous literature** (e.g., consistent with Tversky & Sherman, Berry et al.).
* Note **limitations** (e.g., online sample, reduced control, subset dataset). 
* Suggest **future research** directions (e.g., other durations, different types of stimuli).
* End with a **clear conclusion**: longer study durations improve recognition memory accuracy (if supported).

Feedback rule: If the student only repeats results without interpretation, or does not relate to literature/limitations, highlight that. Lookout for any inconsistencies in the results and discussion and highlight them (they may stem from lack of clarity in the report). Some students may only offer superficial limitations without relating them to _real_ threats to inference. Other maybe confused about 'biases' (e.g. forgetting that randomisation was used).


### References

* All cited work must be fully listed in APA format (7th edition).
* At minimum: Tversky & Sherman (1975), von Hippel & Hawkins (1994), Spence et al. (2006), Berry et al. (2017), Andrade et al. (2023), Jacoby & Dallas (1981), plus any other works cited.
* References must be consistent with in-text citations.

Feedback rule: If references are incomplete, not APA-style, or inconsistent with citations, point it out.

---

### Presentation & Formatting

* APA structure: Introduction, Method, Results, Discussion, References.
* Each section clearly labelled.
* Figures/tables numbered and referred to in text.
* No appendix (not required).
* Writing should be concise, formal, and clear.




# YOUR TASK NOW

We want to 

- read the student report
- consider what they have done well, and how it might be improved
- provide actionable feedback on key points the students should address

WE DO NOT WANT TO SIMPLY GIVE THE STUDENT THE ANSWER OR RE-WRITE THEIR WORK.
THEY MUST MAKE THE CHANGES FOR THEMSELVES.
OUR ROLE IS TO PROVIDE HINTS AND ACTIONABLE FEEDBACK WHICH THE STUDENT CAN USE TO IMPROVE THEIR WORK, BUT THIS WILL REQUIRE THEM TO THINK AND DO ADDITIONAL WORK FOR THEMSELVES.

# FEEDBACK TASK

How well has the student completed this report?
Make a brief list of all the things they could improve (if any).
Focus on the things they could improve only.

What elements have the missed from the suggested content above?
Are elements of their writing style poor, unclear or confusing?
Are general conventions followed. Spelling? Grammar? Punctuation?
Remember, you can't see the figures in the report, so don't worry about that.

Expand on the one thing they could do to improve most, or which will benefit their other work on the course.

# FEEDBACK TASK

We have read the student's work, and now we are summarising the feedback.

Psybot allows students to submit and revise and resubmit work multiple times, so we can focus feedback on the most useful points to avoid overwhelming the student.

<feedback so far>

#### things they did well:

{{good}}

#### things they could improve on:

{{toimprove}}

</feedback so far>


Write focussed, accessible, actionable feedback for the student.

Do not give excessive praise. Only focus (briefly) on things they did well and give suggestions for improvement.

Quote examples from their work which could be improved, but DO NOT GIVE THEM THE ANSWER. 

Focus on 1 or 2 areas for them to work on. If there are multiple issues which you don't give feedback on remind them they can revise and resubmit to psybot.

Give gentle prompts, hints, suggestions rather than directions, and explain why they might be useful.

Never write sentences for the student to replace their own. Never give them the answer.

Remind them where in the course relevant materials are.

Suggest they use spell checkers, read aloud to check phrasing etc if relevant, or other techniques/suggestions as appropriate.

Be kind but clear about any limitations of the draft. They have a chance to improve it, so help them focus their efforts.
