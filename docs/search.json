(Could also mention about email ettiquette)\nPaid work: Ask how much paid work they do. Remind them that this is a FT course and they will be expected to do around 37 hours per week, including recommended preparation and self study.\n\nFuture directions\nDo they want to be a professional psychologist? Clinical/health /forensic? - Are they aware of the various training pathways for them? - Suggest that is something to investigate during the year, mention www.prospects.ac.uk\n\n\nPractical considerations\nBriefings\n\nDid they attend the Briefing meeting on Monday morning at 10am on Zoom?\nIf so, did they find it useful?\nIf not, what prevented them? Encourage future attendance. Briefings will be an important orientation for students through the semester.\n\nPractice\n\nMake sure students know about this site (http://plymouthpsychology.github.io/practice/weekly.html).\nRemind them these tasks are designed to be completed weekly\nPsyBot is an experimental AI tool we are trialling to give targetted feedback.\nThey can upload work to http://psybot.llemma.net to get formative feedback on these tasks (and others in future).\n\nProgress meetings\n\nMention that next meeting will be in week 5/6\nStudents will need to set the agenda for it, and make notes from it\nThere is a practice task which covers this\n\n\n\nLearning about students’ choice of Plymouth\nAs a school we are also very interested to hear from students on these topics:\nWhy Plymouth?\n\nWas there anything special about the place?\nWas there anything special about the university?\nWas there anything special about the course?\n\nOpen/applicant days?\n\nWhat did you like about them?\nDo you have any suggestions for improvements?\nWhat aspect of your degree are you most excited about?"

You you may find later material hard if you do not complete them.\nthe tasks are focused on the core skills required to do well in the course.\ntutors will become concerned if you are not enaged with this important component of the course\nyour ability to practice regularly and reflect and act on feedback is a good indicator of your ability as a student. In stage 3, this information may be used to inform decisions about placements, and in stage 4 potential supervisors will use this information as part of their decision about which students to accept onto their research projects\npractice tasks and progress meetings are the main ways your tutor can get to know you, and will greatly help them when writing a job reference, or academic reference for further study.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Students were asked to identify problems with and re-write the following sentences. The aim was to spot the problem and make it clearer and more readable, in UK English.\n\nExample of the student task\nFirst they saw this example:\n\nThe researchers found evidence of life on Mars, they also found pigs on Jupiter. Problem: Need to use a full stop to separate two different ideas. Re-written: The researchers found evidence of life on Mars. They also found pigs on Jupiter.\n\n\n\nStudents had to correct a further series of sentences\nThese sentences were deliberately crafted to include common mistakes they could correct as practice.\n\n\nYOUR TASK NOW: CHECK STUDENT WORK AND GIVE FEEDBACK\nI am the academic who set the assignment. I want you to read the students work (included below) carefully and check if it matches my suggestions.\nBelow are the sentences students had to fix, and some guidance on what they should have done. I also provide and example of how it could be re-written.\n\nEach child was seated at a table on which there was a display of ten faces. Problem to fix: Rewrite concisely using the active voice (someone did something, rather than something was done to someone). Better version: Each child viewed (a display of) ten faces. (‘a display of’ might be useful to convey that the 10 faces were shown at the same time)\nThe results for both experiments showed that hedgehogs scored 77% and wombats scored 62%. Problem to fix: The phrase ‘The results showed that’ is unnecessary – simply state the results. Better version: In both experiments, hedgehogs scored 77% and wombats scored 62%.\nSeventy marmosets partook in the study. Problem to fix: Partook is a weird term to use and not correct. Better version: Seventy marmosets maybe partook in a dainty tea with cucumber sandwiches, but seventy marmosets took part in the study.\nThe participants were half male and half female. Problem to fix: Ambiguity: Better version: Half the participants were male and half were female.\nThere was no affect of rain on mood. However, mood was effected by videos of kittens. Problem to fix: Affect and effect were the wrong way around. Better version: There was no effect of rain on mood. However, mood was affected by videos of kittens.\n\nSpecial note: These words (affect/effect) are used a lot in psychology, so it is important for students to get them right. - Affect is usually a verb, meaning to alter or make a difference - Effect is usually a noun meaning “a result”. - ‘effect’ can also be a verb meaning “to bring about” or “to cause”. - ‘affect’ can also be a noun meaning mood or emotion, for example ‘Low affect is a symptom of depression’. Pay attention: if students mix up these usages try to offer help.\n\nThe results of this experiment showed that children in the sweets and caffeine condition performed better than children in the lettuce and broccoli condition. Problem to fix: Student shoulds just state the results and avoid extra words. Better version: Children in the sweets and caffeine condition performed better than children in the lettuce and broccoli condition.\nA total of 71 people were used in this study. Problem to fix: Researchers don’t ‘use’ people in experiements. We always respect our participants when we are writing about them. Better version: A total of 71 people took part in this study.\nQuestionnaires were completed by four participants. Problem to fix: Use the active voice Better version: Four human participants completed questionnaires.\n\n\n\nTHE STUDENT’S WORK\n\n{source}\n\n\n\nYOUR FEEDBACK TO STUDENTS\nThink about this step by step. Look through each of the students’ sentences. Did they improve the wording? Does their change match my suggestions?\nIf the student skipped some sentences just note this (make suggestions anyway).\nGive succinct feedback on the sentences the student amended. Praise where they have made the sentence clearer. Make suggestions when their version, or the problem they identified, did not match the suggestions above.\n\n\nFORMATTING THE FEEDBACK\nFor each sentence, use this format to respond:\nLife on Mars: You correctly identified the problem and added a full stop to split this sentence. Good job.\nor\nLife on Mars: The issue here was that the sentence includes two different ideas and is ambiguous. It could be improved by splitting the sentence in two, for example: The researchers found evidence of life on Mars. They also found pigs on Jupiter.\nThe format is:\n&lt;abbreviation of sentence as label…&gt;: &lt;Feedback on the student’s work&gt;. .\nAbbreviate sentences as labels for each para. E.g. “life on mars” or “participants were…”.\nDo not use headings, lists or other formatting. Just use bold, italic and paragraph breaks to separate the examples.\nRespond with a single paragraph per sentence.\nAdditionally give a short summary of how they did.\nFor students who have made errors in this task, be sure to recommend our writing resources page: https://plymouthpsychology.github.io/practice/resources/writing.html\nWrite as though you are giving the feedback to the student face to face."

    "text": "I wanted to see if we could provide auto-feedback on the describe a slide task\nAs a demo , I tried recording myself giving two explanations of this figure, one bad, one slightly better.\n\nbad\nbetter\n\nThese are easy to transcribe with whisper:\nBad:\n\nOh yeah, so this was one of the slides in Chris's lecture and it shows the \nlearning curve so you can see that as you do more trials then the strength \nof the response gets more and more and then after a while it doesn't get \nany stronger.\n\nSo that's what it shows.\n\nBetter\nSo this is a slide from one of Peter's lectures and the title is called Learning Curves,\nbut it's really about the strength of a conditioned response as you do an increasing\nnumber of conditioning trials.\n\nSo basically the graph is a curve and it starts really rising steeply and then it\nlevels off.\n\nSo to begin with you get a big change in the conditioned response for every extra\ntrial you do.\n\nBut after a while it tails off and you get something called an asymptote.\n\nSo that means that after a while you won't get any increase in the conditioned response\nno matter how many trials you do.\n\nAuto feedback\nAnd then I asked it for feedback. This could be made better by providing more context on what a good answer would be, but even with a simple query possibly useful?\n\nYour explanation of the learning curve graph was quite clear and concise! You did a great job describing the key elements of the graph and the concept it represents. Here are some specific points of feedback:\n\nPositives:\n\nClear Description: You clearly explained that the graph shows the strength of a conditioned response in relation to the number of conditioning trials.\nGood Use of Terminology: You correctly used terms like “conditioning trials” and “asymptote,” which are important for understanding the graph.\nLogical Flow: Your explanation followed a logical progression, from describing the initial steep increase to the eventual leveling off of the curve.\n\n\n\nAreas for Improvement:\n\nAvoiding Fillers: While your explanation was generally clear, there were a few instances where you used filler phrases like “So basically” and “But after a while.” These can be reduced to make your explanation even more precise.\nDetails on Asymptote: You mentioned the asymptote but could add a bit more detail on what it represents. For example, you could explain that the asymptote indicates the maximum strength of the conditioned response that can be achieved through conditioning, regardless of the number of additional trials.\n\n\n\nAdditional Points to Consider:\n\nInitial State: You might mention that the strength of the conditioned response starts at a very low level initially before increasing.\nReal-World Examples: Providing a real-world example of a conditioned response, such as Pavlov’s dogs salivating at the sound of a bell, could help to contextualize the graph for your audience.\n\nOverall, you did an excellent job! With a few minor adjustments, your explanation will be even more effective. Keep up the good work!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "ID INSTRUCTIONS\nThe student is required to create an agenda outlining key topics they wish to discuss during a progress meeting with their tutor. Their submission will include specific areas where they need guidance, such as study techniques, understanding course material, or preparing for assessments. The agenda will typically be a mix of personal reflections on their learning challenges and questions seeking advice or clarification from their tutor.\nFEEDBACK INSTRUCTIONS\nAs part of the student’s progress, they have been asked to create an agenda for their upcoming progress meeting. Your role is to review this agenda, provide feedback to help them clarify their goals, and guide them towards proactive steps for improvement. The aim is to support the student in taking ownership of their learning and addressing any challenges they may be facing.\nHere are instructions for a new university tutor on how to review and give feedback on a student’s agenda for a progress meeting:\n\n\nWhat to Look For:\n\nClarity and Focus:\n\nCheck if the agenda items are clearly stated and specific. Vague or overly broad topics may need clarification. For example, instead of “I’m confused about the course,” it’s more useful to focus on specific challenges like “struggling with statistics concepts” or “managing my time better.”\nEnsure that the student has identified areas they want to discuss in relation to their learning, progress, or challenges.\n\nRelevance to Academic Progress:\n\nMake sure the agenda covers important aspects of the student’s learning experience, such as study habits, understanding of course material, feedback on assignments, and preparation for assessments.\nLook for a balance between academic challenges and broader concerns like career planning or use of university resources.\n\nProactive Problem-Solving:\n\nSee if the student is trying to address challenges proactively. Are they asking for advice on how to improve in specific areas (e.g., “How can I better organize my time?”) rather than simply expressing confusion?\nIt’s a good sign if the student is showing initiative by asking how they can make improvements, rather than waiting for solutions to be given to them.\n\nUse of Resources:\n\nCheck if the student is aware of and willing to use university resources (e.g., study support services, office hours, peer groups). If they don’t mention this, it may be worth suggesting that they look into those options.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Write the Feedback:\n\nStart with Encouragement:\n\nBegin with positive reinforcement. Highlight any parts of the agenda that show the student is being thoughtful or reflective about their learning. For example, you might say, “It’s great that you’ve already identified the areas you’re struggling with, like managing time and understanding statistics. Recognizing these challenges is a big first step!”\n\nOffer Constructive Guidance:\n\nFor any vague or unfocused points, provide gentle suggestions on how to clarify or make them more actionable. For example: “You mentioned that you’re unsure how to approach the readings. It might help to identify specific chapters or topics that you find confusing and we can discuss strategies for tackling them.”\n\nProvide Practical Solutions:\n\nSuggest concrete steps they can take to address their concerns. If they’ve written about struggling with essay writing, offer advice like: “In our meeting, we can look at some specific examples from your essay and discuss how to develop a stronger argument. We’ll also talk about structuring your next assignment more effectively.”\n\nEncourage Proactive Learning:\n\nEncourage the student to take responsibility for their own learning by asking follow-up questions or suggesting further actions. For example: “You’re right to start thinking about how to prepare for the upcoming exams. It might be helpful to create a revision schedule—we can discuss how to organize one during our meeting.”\n\nKeep the Tone Supportive:\n\nBe understanding and supportive, especially if the student seems unsure or overwhelmed. Avoid being too critical. For instance: “It’s completely normal to feel a bit lost at this stage of your first year, and we can work together to get you on the right track.”\n\n\nAlways remember that the student must send this to their tutor and fellow tutee before the meeting, and should keep good notes of the meeting and circulate these afterwards.\n\n\n\nExample Feedback:\nThank you for sharing your agenda for our upcoming meeting. It’s great to see that you’ve identified […], especially with […]. For […], it might be helpful if we look at […]. I might suggest […].\n\n\nSTUDENTS AGENDA\nThis is what the student submitted:\n{source}\n\n\nYour task\nGive a short paragraph of feedback for the student as described above. Be brief and supportive."

    "text": "Hermann Ebbinghaus, 1850-1909\n\n\n\nOverview\nOver time we forget things, but in the 19th century, Ebbinghaus discovered that we forget things in a predictable way.\nHis work on the ‘forgetting curve’, since replicated (Murre and Dros 2015), showed that we forget things quickly at first, but then more slowly over time.\nReviewing and rehearsing what we have learnt at regular intervals helps us remember things for longer.\nThe forgetting curve diagram below shows this. The dotted lines show how much we remember if we don’t review what we have learned: After 30 days we will have forgotten almost everything(the first line on the graph). But reviewing the material on day 2, 10, 30 and so on interrupts the forgetting process. The forgetting curve becomes less steep, and we remember more of what we learnt for longer.\n\n\n\nThe forgetting curve\n\n\n‘Spaced repetition’ takes advantage of this effect memory. By reviewing things just before you are likely to forget them, we can flatten the forgetting curve and retain information for longer.\nBahrick et al. (1993) showed that spacing your learning over a longer time is much more effective than cramming. They found that when students spaced their revision over 8 weeks, rather than just 2, they could spend half as much time studying and still remember more of the material. Many other studies show the same effect.\n\nSpacing your revision saves you a lot of time.\n\n\n\nHow to use spaced repetition\nUse Anki!\nAnki is a free, open-source flashcard app that uses spaced repetition to help you remember things.\nYou can create your own flashcards, and Anki schedules a review of the cards at the best possible intervals. The algorithm saves you time, because you will only review material when it has the largest possible benefit to your memory.\n\n\nInstructions\n\nDownload Anki to your computer: https://apps.ankiweb.net\nAdd 10 flashcards to your “deck” based on information in lectures this week (see how below)\nReview these flashcards, and keep practicing over the next few weeks.\nTell Psybot how you got on. Write a short note describing how you found the process, and whether you think it will be useful for you in the future.\n\n\n\nUsing Anki\n\nInstalling Anki and adding cards\nOnce you have installed Anki from: https://apps.ankiweb.net, open the Application.\nIt should look like this:\n\n\n\nThe Anki interface\n\n\nClick “Add” to create your first cards.\n\n\n\nThe Anki interface\n\n\nEnter what you want to see on the “Front” and the “Back” of the flashcard. This is what you will see when you test yourself.\nFor example you might add something like this:\n\n\n\nAdding a card\n\n\nDeciding what to add to your cards is a bit of an art. We have some guidance below, but as some suggestions from lectures this week:\n\nList 3 influences on the quality of encoding\nWhat is deductive reasoning? How does it differ from induction?\nHow do short term and working memory differ from one another?\n\n\n\n\nWriting good cards\nWriting effective Anki cards is a skill. Here are some tips and best practices for creating high-quality cards:\n\nKeep It Simple\n\nOne Fact Per Card: Each card should test only one piece of information. This makes it easier to focus on specific details and ensures that you thoroughly understand each concept. Clear and Concise: Use simple language and avoid unnecessary details. The goal is to make the question and answer as clear as possible.\n\nOnly Add Information You Understand\n\nAvoid Rote Memorization: Don’t add information to your cards if you don’t understand it. Focus on comprehension rather than memorization. A good tip is to add material as you cover it during the year (don’t try and add the textbook!)\n\nUse Images and Mnemonics\n\nVisual Aids: Where possible, include images, diagrams, or charts. Visual information can enhance memory retention and make studying more engaging. Mnemonics: Use mnemonic devices to help remember complex information. Associating facts with memorable phrases or images can improve recall.\n\nActive Recall\n\nFormulate Questions: Instead of simply noting down facts, turn them into questions. This engages your brain more actively and improves learning. Avoid Yes/No Questions: These don’t encourage deep thinking. Use open-ended questions that require a detailed answer.\n\nContextual Learning\n\nAdd Context: Where applicable, provide a brief context or example to explain why the information is relevant or how it is used. Link Concepts: Create cards that connect related ideas, showing how different pieces of information fit together.\n\nPersonalize Your Cards\n\nRelate to Your Experiences: Customize cards with examples that are meaningful to you. This personal touch can make the information more memorable. Use Your Own Words: Writing in your own words helps ensure that you understand the material and makes it easier to recall.\n\n\nExtension activities\n\n\n\nMake sure you review your cards regularly. You can also add and review cards on your phone:\n\nAnkiDroid for Android (free)\niPhone (paid app)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\nReferences\n\nBahrick, Harry P, Lorraine E Bahrick, Audrey S Bahrick, and Phyllis E Bahrick. 1993. “Maintenance of Foreign Language Vocabulary and the Spacing Effect.” Psychological Science 4 (5): 316–21.\n\n\nMurre, Jaap MJ, and Joeri Dros. 2015. “Replication and Analysis of Ebbinghaus’ Forgetting Curve.” PloS One 10 (7): e0120644."

One study suggested that up to 50% of smokers may eventually die from smoking-related causes, though further context is required. Another study aimed to determine whether quitting smoking could reduce mortality rates but found no statistically significant results. Research has also explored the genetic factors influencing smoking-related mortality. While we sought literature on gender differences in smoking-related health outcomes, there appears to be limited research in this area, highlighting a potential gap that warrants further investigation.\n\n\nSTUDENT WORK\nThe student has attempted this task below:\n{source}\n\n\nYOUR TASK\nGive the student feedback on the comments they added to the paragraph, or the revised and updated version.\nMake sure they are sarcastic enough! the task is supposed to be fun, but by being mean they show they can be critical of the original writing and think like a tired marker might…\nHowever, always be kind in the feedback you give.

This exercise is designed to help you write clearly by correcting errors made by other students. We have included some common mistakes that make us smile or groan.\n\n\nOverview\n[THE TEXT BELOW COMPRISES THE VIDEO EXPLAINER]\nYou have got to university so you are probably pretty good at writing already, but sometimes focusing on new psychology content can distract you from the basics of grammar. It’s upsetting when a student has clearly done lots of research but written it up poorly. I’m often thinking ‘I can guess what they wanted to say but they haven’t actually said it so I can’t give them the marks’.\nHear what some of my colleagues think about writing:\nBen Whalley: “I always feel a little sad when I start reading and essay and see a student who struggles with their writing… on one hand, I want to be able give them the benefit of the doubt and give them credit for the learning they have done. But on the other I know that someone who writes poorly is often hard to distinguish from someone who hasn’t quite grasped the ideas or has mixed them up.”\nSOMEONE ESLE: “when I’m tired at the end of a long stack of essays it’s hard not to interpret spelling mistakes and grammar errors as a lack of effort… they are so easily caught using Word’s grammar checker or online tools like chatgpt or grammarly that I never quite understand how they slip though”.\nANOD OTNER: “If someone’s applying for a job with me then they must be able to write clearly. If I have to check what they have written and correct it, that’s extra work for me”.\nI want you to write clearly and concisely so you can really show off the work that you are going to put into your essays and reports. This task will help you avoid some common mistakes and signpost the different sources of help for improving your writing as you progress through the course.\n\n\nInstructions\n\nMarking students’ work\nThe sentences below include common mistakes from students’ coursework. Can you explain what the problem with the sentence is and write a correct version that fixes it?\nWe have done the first one for you. Copy and paste the text below into a document, fill in the blanks, then upload it for feedback from psybot.\n\n\nThis is an example of an ambiguous sentence that needs to be re-written:\n\n\nThe researchers found evidence of life on Mars, they also found pigs on Jupiter.\n\n\nThe problem: The sentence is missing a full stop to separate two different ideas.\nRe-written version:\n\nThe researchers found evidence of life on Mars. They also found pigs on Jupiter.\n\n\nAdditional examples to complete for yourself\n\nCopy the examples\n\n\n\n\nEach child was seated at a table on which there was a display of ten faces.\n\nProblem: &lt; what is the problem with this sentence? &gt;\nRe-written: &lt; your corrected version here &gt;\n\nThe results for both experiments showed that hedgehogs scored 77% and wombats scored 62%.\n\nProblem: ?\nRe-written: &lt; your corrected version here &gt;\n\nSeventy marmosets partook in the study.\n\nProblem:\nRe-written:\n\nThe participants were half male and half female.\n\nProblem:\nRe-written:\n\nThere was no affect of rain on mood.

Follow these steps carefully during and after the lecture to get the most out of this new note-taking technique.\n\nBefore the Lecture:\nPrepare your paper or digital template:\n\nPrint the Cornell Note-Taking Template or open it digitally.\nNotice the page is divided into the three key sections (if using blank paper):\n\nNote-taking area (Right, about 70% of the page)\nCue column (Left, about 30% of the page)\nSummary section (Bottom, 2-3 lines across the whole width)\n\n\n\n\nDuring the Lecture:\nTake notes in the Note-taking area:\n\nWrite down the main points, key concepts, and important facts.\nUse bullet points, shorthand, or whatever style you are comfortable with to capture the information.\nDon’t worry about organizing or filtering the information just yet—this section is for capturing the lecture as it happens.\n\n\n\nAfter the Lecture\nComplete the Cue column:\n\nReview your notes and identify the main themes, ideas, or questions that emerge from the lecture.\nWrite down keywords, questions, or prompts in the left column that will help you recall the material when reviewing later.\nFor example, if your note says “Photosynthesis process,” your cue could be “How does photosynthesis work?”\n\nWrite a Summary: In the summary section at the bottom, condense the entire lecture into 1-2 sentences. This forces you to distill the most important ideas and creates a quick reference for future studying.\n\n\nTop Tip: Review your notes right after the lecture\nThis method is especially powerful when you actively revisit your notes, use the cues to test yourself, and summarize regularly.\nTry to review notes right after the lecture, and certainly on the same day while everything is fresh in your mind."

    "text": "Overview\nWhat to do in lectures might seem obvious, but is it really?\nEveryone will have their own view about how to make the most of lectures, and what techniques will work best. However, Psychology is about producing empirical evidence to support this sort of claim. Ideally, we want to make decisions based on the best available evidence, rather than guesses or hunches.\nLet’s focus on a specific example:\n\nHow should students make notes in lectures?\n\nSpecifically, should students use laptops or make handwritten notes?\nPlease read the extract below from Mueller & Oppenheimer (2014), which describes a study conducted in 2014:\n\nSTUDY 1\nParticipants were 67 students (33 male, 33 female, 1 unknown) from the Princeton University subject pool. Two participants were excluded, 1 because he had seen the lecture serving as the stimulus prior to participation, and 1 because of a data-recording error.\nMaterials: We selected five TED Talks https://www.ted.com/talks) for length (slightly over 15 min) and to cover topics that would be interesting but not common knowledge.2 Laptops had full-size (11-in. × 4-in.) keyboards and were disconnected from the Internet.\nProcedure: Students generally participated 2 at a time, though some completed the study alone. The room was preset with either laptops or notebooks, according to condition. Lectures were projected onto a screen at the front of the room. Participants were instructed to use their normal classroom note-taking strategy, because experimenters were interested in how information was actually recorded in class lectures. The experimenter left the room while the lecture played. Next, participants were taken to a lab; they completed two 5-min distractor tasks and engaged in a taxing working memory task (viz., a reading span task; Unsworth, Heitz, Schrock, & Engle, 2005). At this point, approximately 30 min had elapsed since the end of the lecture. Finally, participants responded to both factual-recall questions (e.g., “Approximately how many years ago did the Indus civilization exist?”) and conceptual-application questions (e.g., “How do Japan and Sweden differ in their approaches to equality within their societies?”) about the lecture and completed demographic measures.\nThe first author scored all responses blind to condition. An independent rater, blind to the purpose of the study and condition, also scored all open-ended questions. Initial interrater reliability was good (α = .89); score disputes between raters were resolved by discussion. Longhand notes were transcribed into text files.\n\n\nThe main results of this study were presented in a graph, shown below (Fig. 1). The y axis shows z scores, which are a way of comparing different scores on the same scale. Note that the average score of a z score will always be zero:\n\n\n\nFig 1. from Mueller et al.\n\n\n\n\nInstructions\n\n\nSummarise the text and the result shown in the figure in your own words. Be concise: no more than 50 words.\nReflect on what the study tells us, and how it might influence what you do in lectures. In particular, you might like to consider these questions:\n\n\nIs the study finding clear?\nDoes the data gathered relate to your own circumstances?\nIs this ‘good’ evidence?\nHas it changed your mind about how you might take notes in lectures?\n\nIMPORTANT: There may not be a simple ‘right’ answer to these questions. The goal is to think critically about the study and how it might influence your own behaviour.\n\n\n\n\nRecording your work and getting feedback\n\nThe task is to:\n\nwrite the summary (3 or 4 short sentences), and\nadd a short reflection (1 or 2 paragraphs max) on the questions above\n\nWhen complete, upload your answer to Psybot to get some feedback.\nShow your work to Psybot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

Here are some tips to help you plan your reference.\n\nFirst, you need to think about who you want to write your reference. You need to choose someone who knows you well and can write a good reference for you — this will typically be your tutor, but could also be a project supervisor from stage 4. You need to choose someone who can write about your skills, experience, and achievements.\nYou need to help the reference-writer do a good job for you! Provide as much information as you can about yourself, your skills, experience, and achievements. You should also provide the reference-writer with a copy of the job description or course you are applying for, and highlight anything you would like them to mention.\n\n\nIn this task we will start the process of planning your reference, and considering what you would like it to say. From there we’ll work back to what you’ll need to do to ensure it’s a good one. Check back for more details soon."

It’s the thing you do that makes you good.”\n— Gladwell (2008)\nYou might have heard of the “10,000 hour rule”; it suggests that it takes 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert in a field. However, recent research suggests that it is not just the quantity of practice that matters, but the quality of practice1\nThe idea of “Deliberate Practice” was described by Anders Ericsson to emphaise the importance of focused, structured practice in developing expertise (Ericsson et al., 1993).",

A meta-analysis (i.e. a review of all the quantitative studies available, Macnamara et al., 2014) suggested that the relationship between practice and expertise was not as strong has had been claimed. However, deliberate practice remains the primary predictor of expertise in many fields, and is typically the only factor which we have individual control over. Inherited general intelligence or working memory capacity may also predict expertise, but we can’t choose our parents! For a detailed discussion of the evidence, see Hambrick et al. (2020).↩︎",
