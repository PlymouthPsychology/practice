However, recent research suggests that it is not just the quantity of practice that matters, but the quality of practice1\nThe idea of “Deliberate Practice” was described by Anders Ericsson to emphaise the importance of focused, structured practice in developing expertise (Ericsson et al., 1993).",

However, deliberate practice remains the primary predictor of expertise in many fields, and is typically the only factor which we have individual control over.

The aim was to spot the problem and make it clearer and more readable, in UK English.\n\nExample of the student task\nFirst they saw this example:\n\nThe researchers found evidence of life on Mars, they also found pigs on Jupiter. Problem: Need to use a full stop to separate two different ideas. Re-written: The researchers found evidence of life on Mars. They also found pigs on Jupiter.\n\n\n\nStudents had to correct a further series of sentences\nThese sentences were deliberately crafted to include common mistakes they could correct as practice.\n\n\nYOUR TASK NOW: CHECK STUDENT WORK AND GIVE FEEDBACK\nI am the academic who set the assignment. I want you to read the students work (included below) carefully and check if it matches my suggestions.\nBelow are the sentences students had to fix, and some guidance on what they should have done. I also provide and example of how it could be re-written.\n\nEach child was seated at a table on which there was a display of ten faces. Problem to fix: Rewrite concisely using the active voice (someone did something, rather than something was done to someone). Better version: Each child viewed (a display of) ten faces. (‘a display of’ might be useful to convey that the 10 faces were shown at the same time)\nThe results for both experiments showed that hedgehogs scored 77% and wombats scored 62%. Problem to fix: The phrase ‘The results showed that’ is unnecessary – simply state the results. Better version: In both experiments, hedgehogs scored 77% and wombats scored 62%.\nSeventy marmosets partook in the study. Problem to fix: Partook is a weird term to use and not correct. Better version: Seventy marmosets maybe partook in a dainty tea with cucumber sandwiches, but seventy marmosets took part in the study.\nThe participants were half male and half female. Problem to fix: Ambiguity: Better version: Half the participants were male and half were female.\nThere was no affect of rain on mood. However, mood was effected by videos of kittens. Problem to fix: Affect and effect were the wrong way around. Better version: There was no effect of rain on mood. However, mood was affected by videos of kittens.\n\nSpecial note: These words (affect/effect) are used a lot in psychology, so it is important for students to get them right. - Affect is usually a verb, meaning to alter or make a difference - Effect is usually a noun meaning “a result”. - ‘effect’ can also be a verb meaning “to bring about” or “to cause”. - ‘affect’ can also be a noun meaning mood or emotion, for example ‘Low affect is a symptom of depression’. Pay attention: if students mix up these usages try to offer help.\n\nThe results of this experiment showed that children in the sweets and caffeine condition performed better than children in the lettuce and broccoli condition. Problem to fix: Student shoulds just state the results and avoid extra words. Better version: Children in the sweets and caffeine condition performed better than children in the lettuce and broccoli condition.\nA total of 71 people were used in this study. Problem to fix: Researchers don’t ‘use’ people in experiements. We always respect our participants when we are writing about them. Better version: A total of 71 people took part in this study.\nQuestionnaires were completed by four participants. Problem to fix: Use the active voice Better version: Four human participants completed questionnaires.\n\n\n\nTHE STUDENT’S WORK\n\n{source}\n\n\n\nYOUR FEEDBACK TO STUDENTS\nThink about this step by step. Look through each of the students’ sentences. Did they improve the wording? Does their change match my suggestions?\nIf the student skipped some sentences just note this (make suggestions anyway).\nGive succinct feedback on the sentences the student amended. Praise where they have made the sentence clearer. Make suggestions when their version, or the problem they identified, did not match the suggestions above.\n\n\nFORMATTING THE FEEDBACK\nFor each sentence, use this format to respond:\nLife on Mars: You correctly identified the problem and added a full stop to split this sentence. Good job.\nor\nLife on Mars: The issue here was that the sentence includes two different ideas and is ambiguous. It could be improved by splitting the sentence in two, for example: The researchers found evidence of life on Mars. They also found pigs on Jupiter.\nThe format is:\n&lt;abbreviation of sentence as label…&gt;: &lt;Feedback on the student’s work&gt;. .\nAbbreviate sentences as labels for each para. E.g. “life on mars” or “participants were…”.\nDo not use headings, lists or other formatting. Just use bold, italic and paragraph breaks to separate the examples.\nRespond with a single paragraph per sentence.\nAdditionally give a short summary of how they did.\nFor students who have made errors in this task, be sure to recommend our writing resources page: https://plymouthpsychology.github.io/practice/resources/writing.html\nWrite as though you are giving the feedback to the student face to face."

    "text": "I wanted to see if we could provide auto-feedback on the describe a slide task\nAs a demo , I tried recording myself giving two explanations of this figure, one bad, one slightly better.\n\nbad\nbetter\n\nThese are easy to transcribe with whisper:\nBad:\n\nOh yeah, so this was one of the slides in Chris's lecture and it shows the \nlearning curve so you can see that as you do more trials then the strength \nof the response gets more and more and then after a while it doesn't get \nany stronger.\n\nSo that's what it shows.\n\nBetter\nSo this is a slide from one of Peter's lectures and the title is called Learning Curves,\nbut it's really about the strength of a conditioned response as you do an increasing\nnumber of conditioning trials.\n\nSo basically the graph is a curve and it starts really rising steeply and then it\nlevels off.\n\nSo to begin with you get a big change in the conditioned response for every extra\ntrial you do.\n\nBut after a while it tails off and you get something called an asymptote.\n\nSo that means that after a while you won't get any increase in the conditioned response\nno matter how many trials you do.\n\nAuto feedback\nAnd then I asked it for feedback. This could be made better by providing more context on what a good answer would be, but even with a simple query possibly useful?\n\nYour explanation of the learning curve graph was quite clear and concise! You did a great job describing the key elements of the graph and the concept it represents. Here are some specific points of feedback:\n\nPositives:\n\nClear Description: You clearly explained that the graph shows the strength of a conditioned response in relation to the number of conditioning trials.\nGood Use of Terminology: You correctly used terms like “conditioning trials” and “asymptote,” which are important for understanding the graph.\nLogical Flow: Your explanation followed a logical progression, from describing the initial steep increase to the eventual leveling off of the curve.\n\n\n\nAreas for Improvement:\n\nAvoiding Fillers: While your explanation was generally clear, there were a few instances where you used filler phrases like “So basically” and “But after a while.” These can be reduced to make your explanation even more precise.\nDetails on Asymptote: You mentioned the asymptote but could add a bit more detail on what it represents. For example, you could explain that the asymptote indicates the maximum strength of the conditioned response that can be achieved through conditioning, regardless of the number of additional trials.\n\n\n\nAdditional Points to Consider:\n\nInitial State: You might mention that the strength of the conditioned response starts at a very low level initially before increasing.\nReal-World Examples: Providing a real-world example of a conditioned response, such as Pavlov’s dogs salivating at the sound of a bell, could help to contextualize the graph for your audience.\n\nOverall, you did an excellent job! With a few minor adjustments, your explanation will be even more effective. Keep up the good work!"

    "text": "Hermann Ebbinghaus, 1850-1909\n\n\n\nOverview\nXXX TODO ADD A VIDEO EXPLAINER OF ALL THIS MATERIAL AT THE HEAD OF THE PAGE\nOver time we forget things, but in the 19th century, Ebbinghaus discovered that we forget things in a predictable way.\nHis work on the ‘forgetting curve’, since replicated (Murre and Dros 2015), showed that we forget things quickly at first, but then more slowly over time.\nReviewing and rehearsing what we have learnt at regular intervals helps us remember things for longer.\nThe forgetting curve diagram below shows this: Without reviewing what we learn, after 30 days we will have forgotten almost all of of it (the first line on the graph). But reviewing the material on day 2, 10, 30 and so on interrupts the forgetting process. The forgetting curve becomes less steep, and we remember more of what we have learnt for longer.\n\n\n\nTODO REPLACE/REDRAW IMAGE\n\n\n‘Spaced repetition’ is a technique that makes use of this property of memory. By reviewing things just before you are likely to forget them, research suggests that you can flatten the forgetting curve and retain information for much longer.\nBahrick et al. (1993) showed that spacing your learning over a longer time is much more effective than cramming. They found that when students spaced their revision over 8 weeks, rather than just 2, they could spend half as much time studying and still remember more of the material. Many other studies show the same effect.\n\n\nHow to use spaced repetition\nUse Anki!\nAnki is a free, open-source flashcard app that uses spaced repetition to help you remember things.\nYou can create your own flashcards, and Anki schedules a review of the cards at the best possible intervals. The algorithm saves you time, because you will only review material when it has the largest possible benefit to your memory.\n\n\nInstructions\n\nDownload Anki to your computer: https://apps.ankiweb.net\nAdd 10 flashcards to your “deck” based on information in lectures this week (see how below)\nReview the flashcards, and keep practicing over the next few weeks.\nMake a note on Psylab. Write a short paragraph describing how you found the process, and whether you think it will be useful for you in the future.\n\n\n\nUsing Anki\n\nInstalling Anki and adding cards\nOnce you have installed Anki from: https://apps.ankiweb.net, open the Application.\nIt should look like this:\n\n\n\nThe Anki interface\n\n\nClick “Add” to create your first cards.\n\n\n\nThe Anki interface\n\n\nEnter what you want to see on the “Front” and the “Back” of the flashcard. This is what you will see when you test yourself.\nFor example you might add something like this:\n\n\n\nAdding a card\n\n\nDeciding what to add to your cards is a bit of an art. We have some guidance below, but as some suggestions from lectures this week:\n\nXXX ADD a list of 3 facts from lectures we suggest here\n\n\n\n\nWriting good cards\nWriting effective Anki cards is a skill. Here are some tips and best practices for creating high-quality cards:\n\nKeep It Simple\n\nOne Fact Per Card: Each card should test only one piece of information. This makes it easier to focus on specific details and ensures that you thoroughly understand each concept. Clear and Concise: Use simple language and avoid unnecessary details. The goal is to make the question and answer as clear as possible.\n\nOnly Add Information You Understand\n\nAvoid Rote Memorization: Don’t add information to your cards if you don’t understand it. Focus on comprehension rather than memorization. A good tip is to add material as you cover it during the year (don’t try and add the textbook!)\n\nUse Images and Mnemonics\n\nVisual Aids: Where possible, include images, diagrams, or charts. Visual information can enhance memory retention and make studying more engaging. Mnemonics: Use mnemonic devices to help remember complex information. Associating facts with memorable phrases or images can improve recall.\n\nActive Recall\n\nFormulate Questions: Instead of simply noting down facts, turn them into questions. This engages your brain more actively and improves learning. Avoid Yes/No Questions: These don’t encourage deep thinking. Use open-ended questions that require a detailed answer.\n\nContextual Learning\n\nAdd Context: Where applicable, provide a brief context or example to explain why the information is relevant or how it is used. Link Concepts: Create cards that connect related ideas, showing how different pieces of information fit together.\n\nPersonalize Your Cards\n\nRelate to Your Experiences: Customize cards with examples that are meaningful to you. This personal touch can make the information more memorable. Use Your Own Words: Writing in your own words helps ensure that you understand the material and makes it easier to recall.\n\n\nExtension activities\nTry adding Anki cards for things outside of your lectures. For example, you could add:\n\nKey terms from your reading\nDefinitions of key concepts\n\nMake sure you review your cards regularly. You can also add and review cards on your phone:\n\nAnkiDroid for Android (free)\niPhone app (paid)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\nReferences\n\nBahrick, Harry P, Lorraine E Bahrick, Audrey S Bahrick, and Phyllis E Bahrick. 1993. “Maintenance of Foreign Language Vocabulary and the Spacing Effect.” Psychological Science 4 (5): 316–21.\n\n\nMurre, Jaap MJ, and Joeri Dros. 2015. “Replication and Analysis of Ebbinghaus’ Forgetting Curve.” PloS One 10 (7): e0120644."

You need to choose someone who knows you well and can write a good reference for you — this will typically be your tutor, but could also be a project supervisor. You need to choose someone who can write about your skills, experience, and achievements.\nYou should think about when you want to ask for your reference. You need to ask for your reference at least a month before you need it. You need to ask for your reference in a polite and professional way (either in person or via email).\nYou need to help the reference-writer do a good job for you! Provide as much information as you can about yourself, your skills, experience, and achievements. You should also provide the reference-writer with a copy of the job description or course you are applying for, and highlight anything you would like them to mention.\n\n\nTODO ADD INSTRUCTIONS HERE"
