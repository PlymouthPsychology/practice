It’s the thing you do that makes you good.”\n— Gladwell (2008)\nYou might have heard of the “10,000 hour rule”; it suggests that it takes 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert in a field. However, recent research suggests that it is not just the quantity of practice that matters, but the quality of practice1\nThe idea of “Deliberate Practice” was described by Anders Ericsson to emphaise the importance of focused, structured practice in developing expertise (Ericsson et al., 1993).",

However, deliberate practice remains the primary predictor of expertise in many fields, and is typically the only factor which we have individual control over. Inherited general intelligence or working memory capacity may also predict expertise, but we can’t choose our parents! For a detailed discussion of the evidence, see Hambrick et al. (2020).↩︎",

    "text": "Loneliness is becoming an increasinly serious problem for young people, and university students in particular. At the same time, the use of social media platforms such as WeChat, Facebook and TikTok has also risen very rapidly and is often described as being problematic or even addictive. Previous research has often shown correlations between these two variables but it is not always clear if loneliness causes social media use or if the opposite is the case. The aim of this study was to examine whether loneliness and problematic social media use predict each other over time in Chinese college students. 877 students were recruited from four universities, with a final sample of 538 analysed after dropout, which was not considered to have a major effect on the results. Participants completed questionairs on loneliness and social media use, along with other demographic details, at three time points across one year. The data were analized using cross-lagged models and latent growth models in SPSS 26 and MPlus 8.3. Results showed loneliness significantly predicted problematic social media use at later timepoints, and problematic social media use also predicted loneliness. Both variables also increased gradually over the year of study. The results showed significant intercepts and slopes for both loneliness and problematic social media use, which were found to be correlated together. These findings suggest that loneliness and problematic social media use have a bi-directional relation, meaning that each one increases the other. This has important implication for university students in China and maybe other countrys too. Educators and policymakers should perhaps consider making interventions to reduce loneliness and also to encourage more healthy social media habbits in students."

Both PSA and SAD are associated with negative occupational, educational, and social consequences.\nSeveral studies have investigated the efficacy of various psychological interventions for PSA, with exposure therapy being particularly effective.\nExposure therapy involves systematically progressing through a hierarchy of fearful situations to reduce fear responses.\nRecent trends include using virtual reality (VR) for delivering exposure therapy, which has been shown to be effective.\nPrevious studies had not investigated whether VR Exposure Therapy’s effectiveness depends on whether the participant is exposed to a VR public speaking event with versus without audiences.\nThe study hypothesised that with VR exposure with an audience will produce greater reductions in PSA due to higher fear activation."

    "text": "Overview\nMany students find it challenging to connect their daily actions with their long-term career goals.\nYou might know you’re interested in psychology, but struggle to see how your current studies and activities link to your future aspirations.\nThis activity uses a values-based approach to career planning. Rather than simply following opportunities as they arise, you’ll identify what really matters to you and use these core values as a foundation for making decisions about how you spend your time.\nWe’ll be using psychological principles of self-reflection and goal-setting in your own life.\n\n\nInstructions\n\nStep 1: Values Discovery (5 minutes)\nFrom the list below, select 7 values that resonate most strongly with you. These should be things you consider non-negotiable or deeply important:\n\nAccomplishment: an act or instance of carrying into effect; fulfillment\nAccountability: an obligation or willingness to accept responsibility for one’s actions\nCharity: generosity and helpfulness towards the needy\nCommitment: an agreement to do something in the future; a pledge\nCommunity: a social, religious, or occupational group sharing common interests\nCompassion: feeling sympathy for those stricken by misfortune, with a desire to alleviate the suffering\nCompetition: a contest for some prize, honor, or advantage\nConviction: a fixed or firm belief\nCreativity: the ability to transcend traditional ideas, rules, patterns, or relationships; originality\nDecisiveness: displaying no or little hesitation; resolute; determined\nDiscipline: behavior in accord with rules of conduct; behavior maintained by training and control\nDiversity: the inclusion of different types of people\nEffectiveness: producing a purpose; producing the intended or expected result\nEfficiency: able to accomplish something with the least waste of time and effort\nExcellence: possessing outstanding quality or superior merit; remarkably good\nFaith: belief in God or the doctrines or teachings of religion\nFreedom: the power to determine action without restraint\nFun: what provides amusement or enjoyment\nGenerosity: readiness or liberality in giving\nGrace: favor or goodwill; unmerited divine assistance\nGratitude: the quality or feeling of being grateful or thankful\nGrowth: development from a simpler to a more complex stage\nHarmony: when people are able to work together\nHealth: the condition of being sound in body, mind, or spirit\nHonesty: uprightness and fairness; truthfulness, sincerity, or frankness\nHonor: high respect, as for worth, merit, or rank\nHumility: freedom from pride or arrogance\nImagination: creative ability; ability to face and resolve difficulties; resourcefulness\nIndependence: freedom from the control, influence, support, or aid of others\nInnovation: the introduction of something new\nIntegrity: firm adherence to a moral code and ethical principles; honesty\nIntelligence: capacity for learning, reasoning, and understanding; aptitude in grasping truths, relationships, facts, meanings, etc.\nJustice: righteousness, equitableness, or moral rightness\nKindness: having, showing, or proceeding from benevolence; indulgent, considerate, or helpful; humane\nLearning: knowledge or skill acquired by instruction or study\nLove: strong affection for another\nLoyalty: faithfulness to commitments or obligations\nOptimism: an inclination to believe the most favorable in actions and events\nPassion: intense, driving, or conviction\nPerseverance: to achieve something despite difficulties or failure\nPower: ability to act or produce an effect; authority\nProfessionalism: the conduct, behavior, and attitude of someone in a work or business environment\nProsperity: a successful, flourishing, or thriving condition, especially in financial respects; good fortune\nPurpose: the reason why something exists or is done, made, used, etc.\nQuality: character with respect to fineness or degree of excellence\nRecognition: special notice or attention; the acknowledgment of achievement, service, merit, etc.\nRelationships: a connection, association, or involvement with those you care about\nRespect: high regard; proper acceptance or courtesy; acknowledgment\nResponsibility: the state being answerable or accountable for something within one’s power, control, or management\nRisk Taking: the willingness to embrace challenges that may be hazardous\nSecurity: freedom from fear and anxiety\nService: contribution to the welfare of others\nSpontaneity: arising from a natural impulse or tendency; unplanned\nStability: steadfastness; constancy, as of character or purpose\nSuccess: the accomplishment of one’s goals; the attainment of wealth, position, or honors\nTeamwork: work done by several associates with each doing their part\nTolerance: a fair, objective, and permissive attitude toward opinions, beliefs, and practices that differ from one’s own\nTradition: an inherited or customary pattern of thought, behavior, or action\nTrust: reliance on the integrity, strength, ability of a person or thing; confidence\nWisdom: knowledge of what is true or right coupled with just judgment as to action; discernment, or insight\n\nIf something you think is important isn’t here, add your own.\n\n\nStep 2: Identify Your Top 3 Core Values (3 minutes)\nFrom your 7 selected values, rank them in order of importance.

This could be made better by providing more context on what a good answer would be, but even with a simple query possibly useful?\n\nYour explanation of the learning curve graph was quite clear and concise! You did a great job describing the key elements of the graph and the concept it represents. Here are some specific points of feedback:\n\nPositives:\n\nClear Description: You clearly explained that the graph shows the strength of a conditioned response in relation to the number of conditioning trials.\nGood Use of Terminology: You correctly used terms like “conditioning trials” and “asymptote,” which are important for understanding the graph.\nLogical Flow: Your explanation followed a logical progression, from describing the initial steep increase to the eventual leveling off of the curve.\n\n\n\nAreas for Improvement:\n\nAvoiding Fillers: While your explanation was generally clear, there were a few instances where you used filler phrases like “So basically” and “But after a while.” These can be reduced to make your explanation even more precise.\nDetails on Asymptote: You mentioned the asymptote but could add a bit more detail on what it represents. For example, you could explain that the asymptote indicates the maximum strength of the conditioned response that can be achieved through conditioning, regardless of the number of additional trials.\n\n\n\nAdditional Points to Consider:\n\nInitial State: You might mention that the strength of the conditioned response starts at a very low level initially before increasing.\nReal-World Examples: Providing a real-world example of a conditioned response, such as Pavlov’s dogs salivating at the sound of a bell, could help to contextualize the graph for your audience.\n\nOverall, you did an excellent job! With a few minor adjustments, your explanation will be even more effective. Keep up the good work!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "ID INSTRUCTIONS\nThe student is required to create an agenda outlining key topics they wish to discuss during a progress meeting with their tutor. Their submission will include specific areas where they need guidance, such as study techniques, understanding course material, or preparing for assessments. The agenda will typically be a mix of personal reflections on their learning challenges and questions seeking advice or clarification from their tutor.\nFEEDBACK INSTRUCTIONS\nAs part of the student’s progress, they have been asked to create an agenda for their upcoming progress meeting. Your role is to review this agenda, provide feedback to help them clarify their goals, and guide them towards proactive steps for improvement. The aim is to support the student in taking ownership of their learning and addressing any challenges they may be facing.\nHere are instructions for a new university tutor on how to review and give feedback on a student’s agenda for a progress meeting:\n\n\nWhat to Look For:\n\nClarity and Focus:\n\nCheck if the agenda items are clearly stated and specific. Vague or overly broad topics may need clarification. For example, instead of “I’m confused about the course,” it’s more useful to focus on specific challenges like “struggling with statistics concepts” or “managing my time better.”\nEnsure that the student has identified areas they want to discuss in relation to their learning, progress, or challenges.\n\nRelevance to Academic Progress:\n\nMake sure the agenda covers important aspects of the student’s learning experience, such as study habits, understanding of course material, feedback on assignments, and preparation for assessments.\nLook for a balance between academic challenges and broader concerns like career planning or use of university resources.\n\nProactive Problem-Solving:\n\nSee if the student is trying to address challenges proactively. Are they asking for advice on how to improve in specific areas (e.g., “How can I better organize my time?”) rather than simply expressing confusion?\nIt’s a good sign if the student is showing initiative by asking how they can make improvements, rather than waiting for solutions to be given to them.\n\nUse of Resources:\n\nCheck if the student is aware of and willing to use university resources (e.g., study support services, office hours, peer groups). If they don’t mention this, it may be worth suggesting that they look into those options.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Write the Feedback:\n\nStart with Encouragement:\n\nBegin with positive reinforcement. Highlight any parts of the agenda that show the student is being thoughtful or reflective about their learning. For example, you might say, “It’s great that you’ve already identified the areas you’re struggling with, like managing time and understanding statistics. Recognizing these challenges is a big first step!”\n\nOffer Constructive Guidance:\n\nFor any vague or unfocused points, provide gentle suggestions on how to clarify or make them more actionable. For example: “You mentioned that you’re unsure how to approach the readings. It might help to identify specific chapters or topics that you find confusing and we can discuss strategies for tackling them.”\n\nProvide Practical Solutions:\n\nSuggest concrete steps they can take to address their concerns. If they’ve written about struggling with essay writing, offer advice like: “In our meeting, we can look at some specific examples from your essay and discuss how to develop a stronger argument. We’ll also talk about structuring your next assignment more effectively.”\n\nEncourage Proactive Learning:\n\nEncourage the student to take responsibility for their own learning by asking follow-up questions or suggesting further actions. For example: “You’re right to start thinking about how to prepare for the upcoming exams. It might be helpful to create a revision schedule—we can discuss how to organize one during our meeting.”\n\nKeep the Tone Supportive:\n\nBe understanding and supportive, especially if the student seems unsure or overwhelmed. Avoid being too critical. For instance: “It’s completely normal to feel a bit lost at this stage of your first year, and we can work together to get you on the right track.”\n\n\nAlways remember that the student must send this to their tutor and fellow tutee before the meeting, and should keep good notes of the meeting and circulate these afterwards.\n\n\n\nExample Feedback:\nThank you for sharing your agenda for our upcoming meeting. It’s great to see that you’ve identified […], especially with […]. For […], it might be helpful if we look at […]. I might suggest […].\n\n\nSTUDENTS AGENDA\nThis is what the student submitted:\n{source}\n\n\nYour task\nGive a short paragraph of feedback for the student as described above. Be brief and supportive."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Hermann Ebbinghaus, 1850-1909\n\n\n\nOverview\nOver time we forget things, but in the 19th century, Ebbinghaus discovered that we forget things in a predictable way.\nHis work on the ‘forgetting curve’, since replicated (Murre and Dros 2015), showed that we forget things quickly at first, but then more slowly over time.\nReviewing and rehearsing what we have learnt at regular intervals helps us remember things for longer.\nThe forgetting curve diagram below shows this. The dotted lines show how much we remember if we don’t review what we have learned: After 30 days we will have forgotten almost everything(the first line on the graph). But reviewing the material on day 2, 10, 30 and so on interrupts the forgetting process. The forgetting curve becomes less steep, and we remember more of what we learnt for longer.\n\n\n\nThe forgetting curve\n\n\n‘Spaced repetition’ takes advantage of this effect memory. By reviewing things just before you are likely to forget them, we can flatten the forgetting curve and retain information for longer.\nBahrick et al. (1993) showed that spacing your learning over a longer time is much more effective than cramming. They found that when students spaced their revision over 8 weeks, rather than just 2, they could spend half as much time studying and still remember more of the material. Many other studies show the same effect.\n\nSpacing your revision saves you a lot of time.\n\n\n\nHow to use spaced repetition\nUse Anki!\nAnki is a free, open-source flashcard app that uses spaced repetition to help you remember things.\nYou can create your own flashcards, and Anki schedules a review of the cards at the best possible intervals. The algorithm saves you time, because you will only review material when it has the largest possible benefit to your memory.\n\n\nInstructions\n\nDownload Anki to your computer: https://apps.ankiweb.net\nAdd 10 flashcards to your “deck” based on information in lectures this week (see how below)\nReview these flashcards, and keep practicing over the next few weeks.\nTell Psybot how you got on. Write a short note describing how you found the process, and whether you think it will be useful for you in the future.\n\nRecord your reflection with Psybot\n\n\nUsing Anki\n\nInstalling Anki and adding cards\nOnce you have installed Anki from: https://apps.ankiweb.net, open the Application.\nIt should look like this:\n\n\n\nThe Anki interface\n\n\nClick “Add” to create your first cards.\n\n\n\nThe Anki interface\n\n\nEnter what you want to see on the “Front” and the “Back” of the flashcard. This is what you will see when you test yourself.\nFor example you might add something like this:\n\n\n\nAdding a card\n\n\nDeciding what to add to your cards is a bit of an art. We have some guidance below, but as some suggestions from lectures this week:\n\nList 3 influences on the quality of encoding\nWhat is deductive reasoning? How does it differ from induction?\nHow do short term and working memory differ from one another?\n\n\n\n\nWriting good cards\nWriting effective Anki cards is a skill. Here are some tips and best practices for creating high-quality cards:\n\nKeep It Simple\n\nOne Fact Per Card: Each card should test only one piece of information. This makes it easier to focus on specific details and ensures that you thoroughly understand each concept. Clear and Concise: Use simple language and avoid unnecessary details. The goal is to make the question and answer as clear as possible.\n\nOnly Add Information You Understand\n\nAvoid Rote Memorization: Don’t add information to your cards if you don’t understand it. Focus on comprehension rather than memorization. A good tip is to add material as you cover it during the year (don’t try and add the textbook!)\n\nUse Images and Mnemonics\n\nVisual Aids: Where possible, include images, diagrams, or charts. Visual information can enhance memory retention and make studying more engaging. Mnemonics: Use mnemonic devices to help remember complex information. Associating facts with memorable phrases or images can improve recall.\n\nActive Recall\n\nFormulate Questions: Instead of simply noting down facts, turn them into questions. This engages your brain more actively and improves learning. Avoid Yes/No Questions: These don’t encourage deep thinking. Use open-ended questions that require a detailed answer.\n\nContextual Learning\n\nAdd Context: Where applicable, provide a brief context or example to explain why the information is relevant or how it is used. Link Concepts: Create cards that connect related ideas, showing how different pieces of information fit together.\n\nPersonalize Your Cards\n\nRelate to Your Experiences: Customize cards with examples that are meaningful to you. This personal touch can make the information more memorable. Use Your Own Words: Writing in your own words helps ensure that you understand the material and makes it easier to recall.\n\n\nExtension activities\n\n\n\nMake sure you review your cards regularly. You can also add and review cards on your phone:\n\nAnkiDroid for Android (free)\niPhone (paid app)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\nReferences\n\nBahrick, Harry P, Lorraine E Bahrick, Audrey S Bahrick, and Phyllis E Bahrick. 1993. “Maintenance of Foreign Language Vocabulary and the Spacing Effect.” Psychological Science 4 (5): 316–21.\n\n\nMurre, Jaap MJ, and Joeri Dros. 2015. “Replication and Analysis of Ebbinghaus’ Forgetting Curve.” PloS One 10 (7): e0120644."

    "text": "Writing your own obituary might sound morbid, but can be a powerful tool for self-reflection and life planning.\nThis technique, studied by psychologist Andrew Bland, helps people move beyond surface-level goals to discover their deeper values and authentic aspirations. Students who complete this exercise often report initial discomfort followed by a profound shift in perspective—greater appreciation for life, clearer sense of purpose, and motivation to live more intentionally.\nThe process works by helping you step outside your day-to-day concerns and see your life from a broader perspective. What would you want people to remember about you? What kind of person do you want to have been? What legacy do you want to leave?\nThis connects well with other growth activities—if you’ve done the career planning task, you might notice how your core values show up in both exercises.\n\nInstructions\n\nThis exercise has three parts. Find a quiet space where you won’t be interrupted for about 45 minutes.\n\nPart 1: Preparation (5 minutes)\nSit quietly and imagine you are much older, looking back on your life. Someone who knows you well is going to write your obituary. This person understands not just what you accomplished, but what your life meant: how you lived, what you valued, how you treated others, what you contributed and so on.\nTake a few deep breaths and allow yourself to think about your life as a complete story.\n\n\nPart 2: Write your obituary (25 minutes)\nWrite your obituary as if written by someone who knew you well. Focus on the meaning of your life rather than just listing achievements. Consider:\n\nWhat kind of person were you?\nWhat values guided your choices?\nHow did you grow and change over your lifetime?\nWhat did you contribute to others’ lives?\nWhat challenges did you overcome?\nWhat brought you joy and fulfillment?\n\nKeep it to less than one page. Don’t worry about making it perfect. Focus on what feels authentic and meaningful to you.\n\n\nPart 3: Reflection (15 minutes)\nAfter writing, reflect on the experience:\n\nWhat feelings came up as you wrote this?\nWhat surprised you about what you wrote?\nHow does this connect to your current choices and priorities?\nWhat does this make you want to change or focus on in your life right now?\n\n\n\n\n\nRecording your work\n\nCreate a short reflection (written or voice note) that includes:\n\nA brief summary of the main themes that emerged in your obituary\nWhat this exercise revealed about your values and priorities\nOne specific way this reflection might influence your choices going forward\n\nSubmit your reflection to Psybot for feedback"

    "text": "title: “Think like a mean marker” subtitle: “Remove distractions from your writing.” author: Jackie Andrade description: “This task helps you think more about the person who is reading your work. You will practice thinking like a very cynical marker and discover how unnecessary phrases or poorly worded sentences can distract from the point the writer is making.”\nWe love clear, concise writing, like you practiced in the first Writing exercise. In this exercise, we want you to get inside the head of the meanest marker you can imagine. This marker has already marked a big stack of coursework. They are tired and grumpy. They have just picked up an essay that contains some of their pet hates. We’d like you to have some fun expressing their frustration. We would like you to act as a super-critical marker – Professor Perfect - and insert your thoughts about the writing. Professor Snippy has provided an example.\nThis is the writing that Prof Snippy is marking:\n\nSince the time of evolution a plethora of research has shown that cows like grass. The first person to research the food preferences of cows was Bloggs (2014), who found that they chose grass more often than baked beans. It is therefore clear that cows like grass.\n\nProf Snippy is marking a student essay and has inserted their thoughts while reading it in square brackets:\n\nSince the time of evolution [What, has evolution stopped??] a plethora of research [How much is a plethora? Does the quantity matter???] has shown that cows like grass. The first person [I think I read an earlier study… Maybe this was the first one the student has heard of. Should I check??] to research the food preferences of cows was Bloggs (2014), who found that they chose grass more often than baked beans. It is therefore clear [It’s not clear to me… choosing grass doesn’t mean cows like it. Maybe they just don’t like baked beans?] that cows like grass.\n\nNotice how Prof Snippy’s comments are not just about the writing, but also about the content. The writing is not clear, and so the content is also unclear. By clearing up the writing Prof. Snippy is more likely to understand the content and give us the benefit of the doubt.\nIn this activity, you will practice thinking like a mean marker.\n\nInstructions\nThis is the writing that Professor Perfect (that’s you!) is marking next.\nAn amazingly vast array of research (__________) has found affects (__________) of smoking on health (Pickle, 1990) (__________). One study found that as many as 50% of all smokers die (__________). Another study tested if quitting smoking reduced death rates but unfortunately its results were insignificant (__________). Some research has looked into genetic factors associated with smoking death rates (__________). We looked for research into gender differences and smokers’ health but there was none, therefore there is a gap in the literature (__________) and further research is needed on this fascinating topic (__________).\n\nCopy it into a file,\nFill in the blanks with your thoughts (be as mean as you can!), and upload it to Psybot\nIf you have time, you could also create an edited and improved version of this paragraph.\n\n\n\nGIVING FEEDBACK\n\n\nEXAMPLE OF A GOOD ANSWER\n&lt;&lt;this is the sort of thing the student might have done. you can use this in your feedback to them to make suggestions to improve&gt;&gt;\nAn amazingly vast array of research [Oh really? ‘Amazingly vast’? What does that even mean? Just say “a lot” if you’re not going to be specific…] has found affects [It’s “effects” not “affects.” Grammar, please!] of smoking on health (Pickle, 1990) [Pickle, 1990? One single study and we’re calling this a vast array?]. One study found that as many as 50% of all smokers die [50% of smokers die? Wow, how insightful. Care to elaborate? Of course, 100% of people die eventually!] . Another study tested if quitting smoking reduced death rates but unfortunately its results were insignificant [So we’re just leaving it at “insignificant”? How about telling us what “insignificant” means here? Statistical insignificance? Clinically irrelevant? Lazy writing.]. Some research has looked into genetic factors associated with smoking death rates [Some research? Be specific! Who did this research? When? How important are these factors?] . We looked for research into gender differences and smokers’ health but there was none, therefore there is a gap in the literature [None? Are you sure there’s NO research? You’re saying this like no one ever thought to look at gender and health before. Very doubtful…] and further research is needed on this fascinating topic [Oh, come on. “Fascinating topic”? This is such a cliché! Of course, research is always needed. Just say something meaningful instead of filling space.].\n&lt;&lt; this is an example of an edited and improved version&gt;&gt;\nNumerous studies have examined the effects of smoking on health (Pickle, 1990). One study suggested that up to 50% of smokers may eventually die from smoking-related causes, though further context is required. Another study aimed to determine whether quitting smoking could reduce mortality rates but found no statistically significant results. Research has also explored the genetic factors influencing smoking-related mortality. While we sought literature on gender differences in smoking-related health outcomes, there appears to be limited research in this area, highlighting a potential gap that warrants further investigation.\n\n\nSTUDENT WORK\nThe student has attempted this task below:\n{source}\n\n\nYOUR TASK\nGive the student feedback on the comments they added to the paragraph, or the revised and updated version.\nMake sure they are sarcastic enough! the task is supposed to be fun, but by being mean they show they can be critical of the original writing and think like a tired marker might…\nHowever, always be kind in the feedback you give. Don’t confuse the task (they must be sarcastic) with your feedback ( you must be supportive)\nBe brief: give feedback in 1 short paragraph. Be positive and encouraging, but use the examples given above as a reference to make suggestions."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Overview\nIn this task, you’ll describe a single slide from a lecture, focusing on the concept of “blocking” in learning experiments, using only the notes you took at the time. You’ll have 100 words to summarize it. The key goal here is to test how well your notes serve as a resource for revision, helping you reflect on the quality of your note-taking and its effectiveness for later study.\nThis exercise is important for several reasons. Research shows that actively engaging with material, such as by summarizing or explaining it, leads to deeper conceptual understanding and better factual recall. This contrasts with passive review strategies, like simply rereading notes, which tend to be less effective. By forcing yourself to retrieve and articulate concepts, you’re strengthening neural connections related to that information, which aids long-term retention and understanding.\nAdditionally, practicing this skill mirrors real-world tasks where you often need to explain complex ideas clearly and concisely. Studies on “retrieval practice” (Roediger and Butler 2011) suggest that actively recalling information improves both factual recall and the ability to apply knowledge in new contexts. Similarly, “elaborative rehearsal”—a method of actively reviewing material by explaining it in your own words—has been shown to foster deeper processing and stronger memory encoding (Craik and Lockhart 1972).\nSo, this task helps not just with memorizing facts, but also with connecting ideas conceptually, reinforcing the learning needed for more complex, higher-order thinking. It’s a good habit to get into for key concepts from all your lectures.\n\n\nInstructions\n\n\nInstructions\n\nConsider the slide on “blocking” from Peter Jones’ lecture shown below (ppt version)\n\n\n\nBlocking slide\n\n\nUse only your notes.\nWithout referring back to the full lecture slides or Panopto, use only the notes you took at the time. This will help you evaluate how useful your notes are for revision purposes.\nSummarize the slide in 100 words.\nIn your own words, describe the concept of “blocking” as it was explained in the lecture. Keep your summary concise, sticking to the 100-word limit.\nReflect on your notes.\nOnce you’ve written your summary, think about whether your notes were helpful. Did they contain the key points? Would they be useful if you were revising for an exam?\n\n\n\nRecording your work\nRecord your explanation AND reflection with Psybot for instant feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nCraik, Fergus IM, and Robert S Lockhart. 1972. “Levels of Processing: A Framework for Memory Research.” Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior 11 (6): 671–84. https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-5371(72)80001-X.\n\n\nRoediger, Henry L, and Andrew C Butler. 2011. “The Critical Role of Retrieval Practice in Long-Term Retention.” Trends in Cognitive Sciences 15 (1): 20–27. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2010.09.003."

Follow these steps carefully during and after the lecture to get the most out of this new note-taking technique.\n\nBefore the Lecture:\nPrepare your paper or digital template:\n\nPrint the Cornell Note-Taking Template or open it digitally.\nNotice the page is divided into the three key sections (if using blank paper):\n\nNote-taking area (Right, about 70% of the page)\nCue column (Left, about 30% of the page)\nSummary section (Bottom, 2-3 lines across the whole width)\n\n\n\n\nDuring the Lecture:\nTake notes in the Note-taking area:\n\nWrite down the main points, key concepts, and important facts.\nUse bullet points, shorthand, or whatever style you are comfortable with to capture the information.\nDon’t worry about organizing or filtering the information just yet—this section is for capturing the lecture as it happens.\n\n\n\nAfter the Lecture\nComplete the Cue column:\n\nReview your notes and identify the main themes, ideas, or questions that emerge from the lecture.\nWrite down keywords, questions, or prompts in the left column that will help you recall the material when reviewing later.\nFor example, if your note says “Photosynthesis process,” your cue could be “How does photosynthesis work?”\n\nWrite a Summary: In the summary section at the bottom, condense the entire lecture into 1-2 sentences. This forces you to distill the most important ideas and creates a quick reference for future studying.\n\n\nTop Tip: Review your notes right after the lecture\nThis method is especially powerful when you actively revisit your notes, use the cues to test yourself, and summarize regularly.\nTry to review notes right after the lecture, and certainly on the same day while everything is fresh in your mind."

    "text": "Overview\nWhat to do in lectures might seem obvious, but is it really?\nEveryone will have their own view about how to make the most of lectures, and what techniques will work best. However, Psychology is about producing empirical evidence to support this sort of claim. Ideally, we want to make decisions based on the best available evidence, rather than guesses or hunches.\nLet’s focus on a specific example:\n\nHow should students make notes in lectures?\n\nSpecifically, should students use laptops or make handwritten notes?\nPlease read the extract below from Mueller & Oppenheimer (2014), which describes a study conducted in 2014:\n\nSTUDY 1\nParticipants were 67 students (33 male, 33 female, 1 unknown) from the Princeton University subject pool. Two participants were excluded, 1 because he had seen the lecture serving as the stimulus prior to participation, and 1 because of a data-recording error.\nMaterials: We selected five TED Talks https://www.ted.com/talks) for length (slightly over 15 min) and to cover topics that would be interesting but not common knowledge.2 Laptops had full-size (11-in. × 4-in.) keyboards and were disconnected from the Internet.\nProcedure: Students generally participated 2 at a time, though some completed the study alone. The room was preset with either laptops or notebooks, according to condition. Lectures were projected onto a screen at the front of the room. Participants were instructed to use their normal classroom note-taking strategy, because experimenters were interested in how information was actually recorded in class lectures. The experimenter left the room while the lecture played. Next, participants were taken to a lab; they completed two 5-min distractor tasks and engaged in a taxing working memory task (viz., a reading span task; Unsworth, Heitz, Schrock, & Engle, 2005). At this point, approximately 30 min had elapsed since the end of the lecture. Finally, participants responded to both factual-recall questions (e.g., “Approximately how many years ago did the Indus civilization exist?”) and conceptual-application questions (e.g., “How do Japan and Sweden differ in their approaches to equality within their societies?”) about the lecture and completed demographic measures.\nThe first author scored all responses blind to condition. An independent rater, blind to the purpose of the study and condition, also scored all open-ended questions. Initial interrater reliability was good (α = .89); score disputes between raters were resolved by discussion. Longhand notes were transcribed into text files.\n\n\nThe main results of this study were presented in a graph, shown below (Fig. 1). The y axis shows z scores, which are a way of comparing different scores on the same scale. Note that the average score of a z score will always be zero:\n\n\n\nFig 1. from Mueller et al.\n\n\n\n\nInstructions\n\n\nSummarise the text and the result shown in the figure in your own words. Be concise: no more than 50 words.\nReflect on what the study tells us, and how it might influence what you do in lectures. In particular, you might like to consider these questions:\n\n\nIs the study finding clear?\nDoes the data gathered relate to your own circumstances?\nIs this ‘good’ evidence?\nHas it changed your mind about how you might take notes in lectures?\n\nIMPORTANT: There may not be a simple ‘right’ answer to these questions. The goal is to think critically about the study and how it might influence your own behaviour.\n\n\n\n\nRecording your work and getting feedback\n\nThe task is to:\n\nwrite the summary (3 or 4 short sentences), and\nadd a short reflection (1 or 2 paragraphs max) on the questions above\n\nWhen complete, upload your answer to Psybot to get some feedback.\nShow your work to Psybot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "text": "Students were asked to identify problems with and re-write the following sentences. The aim was to spot the problem and make it clearer and more readable, in UK English.\n\nExample of the student task\nFirst they saw this example:\n\nThe researchers found evidence of life on Mars, they also found pigs on Jupiter. Problem: Need to use a full stop to separate two different ideas. Re-written: The researchers found evidence of life on Mars. They also found pigs on Jupiter.\n\n\n\nStudents had to correct a further series of sentences\nThese sentences were deliberately crafted to include common mistakes they could correct as practice.\n\n\nYOUR TASK NOW: CHECK STUDENT WORK AND GIVE FEEDBACK\nI am the academic who set the assignment. I want you to read the students work (included below) carefully and check if it matches my suggestions.\nBelow are the sentences students had to fix, and some guidance on what they should have done. I also provide and example of how it could be re-written.\n\nEach child was seated at a table on which there was a display of ten faces. Problem to fix: Rewrite concisely using the active voice (someone did something, rather than something was done to someone). Better version: Each child viewed (a display of) ten faces. (‘a display of’ might be useful to convey that the 10 faces were shown at the same time)\nThe results for both experiments showed that hedgehogs scored 77% and wombats scored 62%. Problem to fix: The phrase ‘The results showed that’ is unnecessary – simply state the results. Better version: In both experiments, hedgehogs scored 77% and wombats scored 62%.\nSeventy marmosets partook in the study. Problem to fix: Partook is a weird term to use and not correct. Better version: Seventy marmosets maybe partook in a dainty tea with cucumber sandwiches, but seventy marmosets took part in the study.\nThe participants were half male and half female. Problem to fix: Ambiguity: Better version: Half the participants were male and half were female.\nThere was no affect of rain on mood. However, mood was effected by videos of kittens. Problem to fix: Affect and effect were the wrong way around. Better version: There was no effect of rain on mood. However, mood was affected by videos of kittens.\n\nSpecial note: These words (affect/effect) are used a lot in psychology, so it is important for students to get them right. - Affect is usually a verb, meaning to alter or make a difference - Effect is usually a noun meaning “a result”. - ‘effect’ can also be a verb meaning “to bring about” or “to cause”. - ‘affect’ can also be a noun meaning mood or emotion, for example ‘Low affect is a symptom of depression’. Pay attention: if students mix up these usages try to offer help.\n\nThe results of this experiment showed that children in the sweets and caffeine condition performed better than children in the lettuce and broccoli condition. Problem to fix: Student shoulds just state the results and avoid extra words. Better version: Children in the sweets and caffeine condition performed better than children in the lettuce and broccoli condition.\nA total of 71 people were used in this study. Problem to fix: Researchers don’t ‘use’ people in experiements. We always respect our participants when we are writing about them. Better version: A total of 71 people took part in this study.\nQuestionnaires were completed by four participants. Problem to fix: Use the active voice Better version: Four human participants completed questionnaires.\n\n\n\nTHE STUDENT’S WORK\n\n{source}\n\n\n\nYOUR FEEDBACK TO STUDENTS\nThink about this step by step. Look through each of the students’ sentences. Did they improve the wording? Does their change match my suggestions?\nIf the student skipped some sentences just note this (make suggestions anyway).\nGive succinct feedback on the sentences the student amended. Praise where they have made the sentence clearer. Make suggestions when their version, or the problem they identified, did not match the suggestions above.\n\n\nFORMATTING THE FEEDBACK\nFor each sentence, use this format to respond:\nLife on Mars: You correctly identified the problem and added a full stop to split this sentence. Good job.\nor\nLife on Mars: The issue here was that the sentence includes two different ideas and is ambiguous. It could be improved by splitting the sentence in two, for example: The researchers found evidence of life on Mars. They also found pigs on Jupiter.\nThe format is:\n&lt;abbreviation of sentence as label…&gt;: &lt;Feedback on the student’s work&gt;. .\nAbbreviate sentences as labels for each para. E.g. “life on mars” or “participants were…”.\nDo not use headings, lists or other formatting. Just use bold, italic and paragraph breaks to separate the examples.\nRespond with a single paragraph per sentence.\nAdditionally give a short summary of how they did.\nFor students who have made errors in this task, be sure to recommend our writing resources page: https://plymouthpsychology.github.io/practice/resources/writing.html\nWrite as though you are giving the feedback to the student face to face."

A total of 877 students from four universities were recruited, of whom 538 provided valid data across three survey waves. Measures included self-report questionnaires on loneliness, social media use, and demographic factors. Analyses revealed a bidirectional relationship: loneliness predicted later problematic social media use, and problematic social media use predicted later loneliness. Both increased significantly across the study period, and growth in one variable predicted growth in the other. These findings suggest a mutually reinforcing cycle between loneliness and problematic social media use at university, highlighting a period of risk. Interventions targeting either factor may help to disrupt this cycle and improve student well-being. Educators, policymakers, and parents should consider ways to reduce loneliness and encourage healthier patterns of online engagement."

    "text": "We often encounter news articles about psychology findings that seem like it might be too good to be true, from “power poses” to “manifesting” things into reality. How do you know if it’s junk science?\n\nThe good news is - leveling-up to become an expert consumer of scientific research will be one of the most useful superpowers you will acquire as you gain your degree in psychology!\nThis tutorial will provide you with an example (fictional) article, and you will be asked to consider whether it is junk science.\n\nLet’s say a family member forwards you the following article:\n\n“Scientists Discover the Secret to Happiness: It’s All About Chocolate!\nA groundbreaking new study has revealed the astonishing truth about happiness: the key lies in chocolate consumption. The study involved a group of volunteers who were given daily doses of chocolate for several weeks. Researchers monitored the participants’ mood levels throughout the study. The results were astonishing: those who consumed chocolate regularly reported significantly higher levels of happiness and well-being compared to those who did not. The findings of this study suggest that incorporating chocolate into your diet may be a delicious and effective way to improve your overall well-being.”\n\nYou decide to track down the original research article to find out for yourself whether its conclusions are valid, so you can tell your family member whether they should start a chocolate binge or not.\nYou read over the Method section and find that the study was a correlational study which involved providing all participants with a large amount of chocolate at the start of a two-week period the study, and participants were asked to complete daily surveys about how much chocolate they ate that day, and what their happiness was that day on average. To analyse the results, the researchers simply correlated the amount of chocolate eaten with the happiness ratings on each day. The Results showed a positive correlation between amount of chocolate consumed and happiness ratings.\n\nThink about the claim in the headline and the study design described in the article.\n\nWhat might be some limitations to this design?\nWhat are some external factors that could be confounded and influence both chocolate consumption and happiness?\nHow might you design the study if you wanted to know whether chocolate eating causes happiness?\n\nMake some notes on these questions. What have you learnt so far on the course that would help decide if this is junk science or useful information?\nAdd your notes to Psybot for instant feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

Two participants were excluded, 1 because he had seen the lecture serving as the stimulus prior to participation, and 1 because of a data-recording error.\n\n\nMaterials: We selected five TED Talks https://www.ted.com/talks) for length (slightly over 15 min) and to cover topics that would be interesting but not common knowledge.2 Laptops had full-size (11-in. × 4-in.) keyboards and were disconnected from the Internet.\n\n\nProcedure: Students generally participated 2 at a time, though some completed the study alone. The room was preset with either laptops or notebooks, according to condition. Lectures were projected onto a screen at the front of the room. Participants were instructed to use their normal classroom note-taking strategy, because experimenters were interested in how information was actually recorded in class lectures. The experimenter left the room while the lecture played. Next, participants were taken to a lab; they completed two 5-min distractor tasks and engaged in a taxing working memory task (viz., a reading span task; Unsworth, Heitz, Schrock, & Engle, 2005). At this point, approximately 30 min had elapsed since the end of the lecture. Finally, participants responded to both factual-recall questions (e.g., “Approximately how many years ago did the Indus civilization exist?”) and conceptual-application questions (e.g., “How do Japan and Sweden differ in their approaches to equality within their societies?”) about the lecture and completed demographic measures.\n\n\nThe first author scored all responses blind to condition. An independent rater, blind to the purpose of the study and condition, also scored all open-ended questions. Initial interrater reliability was good (\\(\\alpha = .89\\)); score disputes between raters were resolved by discussion. Longhand notes were transcribed into text files.\n\nThe main results of this study were presented in a graph, shown below (Fig. 1).\nThe y axis shows z scores, which are a way of comparing different scores on the same scale. The average value of data converted to a z score will always be zero.\n\n\n\nFig 1. from Mueller et al.\n\n\nMueller, P. A., & Oppenheimer, D. M. (2014).

    "text": "Session Overview\nThis tutorial helps students connect their core values to their career planning and daily actions.\nStudents often struggle to see how their current studies link to future goals; this session provides a practical framework for values-based decision making, and setting SMART goals for the next weeks and months.\nIt starts with an icebreaker: We use the things that most frustrate/anger us to identify what matters most (core values).\n\n\nIntroduction\nWelcome students\nExplain that today’s session focuses on values-based career planning.\nMany students feel overwhelmed by career choices or disconnected from their daily actions.\nThis session will help identify what truly matters to them, and use these insights to guide their activity.\n\nIce Breaker: Using Outrage for Good!\nThese days, everyone seems angry about something.\nRather than dismissing that anger, let’s use it.\nOur strongest frustrations sometimes point to the values that matter most to us.\nPrompt students\n\nThink back over the past year.\nWhat are 2–3 things that really annoyed you — moments when you felt genuinely frustrated or outraged?\nThey don’t have to be “serious”; it could be anything from climate inaction to people jumping queues.\n\nDiscuss in pairs Share examples with the person next to you. Perhaps 3-4 minutes\nAs a group Invite 2–3 volunteers (min) to share examples.\nPrompt reflection\n\nWhat do these annoyances reveal about what you actually care for?\nFor example, if stealing milk from the fridge drives you mad, perhaps you really value respect or honesty?\nIf online misinformation winds you up, maybe you care deeply about truth and accuracy?\n\nDiscuss in pairs again ~3-4 minutes again\nAs a group again Share what the students think\n\n\n\nValues Discovery\nOpen the list of values\n\nDirect students to the long list of values here, or scan this QR code to open the list on a phone:\n\n\nInstructions:\n\nQuickly scan and select all values that resonate with them (2-3 mins)\n\nCheck they have all highlighted at least 7 values, preferably more\n\nSecond pass (1-2 minutes): Narrow down to exactly 7 values\nFinal check: Note any important values not on the list?\n\nTutor notes:\n\nHelp students who seem stuck.\nRemind them there are no right or wrong answers.\n\nSharing values\n\nIndividuals or pairs share their 7 values\nNotice any patterns in your group? Any surprising differences?\n\n\n\nRanking values\nInstructions\n\nStudents rank their 7 values in order of importance and\nIdentify their top 3 core values.\n\nPair Discussion\nStudents share their top 3 values with a partner, discussing:\n\nWhy these values matter most to them\nAny challenges in narrowing down to just 3\nHow/why it should influence their choices of career, and their activities in daily life.\n\n\n\nValues and careers\nDiscussion\n\nAsk all students what career plans they have (if any)? Go around the group to share.\nRemind them that there are good psychology-specific resources on the Prospects website\n\nFor each career path you’re considering:\n\nWhich of your core values would this work fulfil?\nWhat values might be compromised?\nHow well does this align with who you are?\n\n\n\nValues and goals\nOur values only influence our lives if they guide what we do each day.\nInstructions\n\nTake your top 3 core values.\nFor each value, brainstorm 1-2 possible goals that would help you live that value out in practice.\n\nExample: If one of your top values is Creativity, a goal might be “Find a dissertation topic that allows me to have input on the design of the study” or “Join a student society that lets me make art/music.”\nIf your value is Justice, a goal might be “Apply for a placement or volunteer in an organisation focused on advocacy or policy change”\n\nNow choose one goal per value that feels most realistic and motivating right now.\nTurn each one into a SMART goal: It must be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.\n\nExample: “By the end of this term, I will attend two careers events to explore organisations working on mental health equity.”\n\n\nPair Discussion\n\nShare one of your SMART goals with your partner.\nAsk: Does this goal clearly reflect the underlying value?\nDoes it meet the SMART criteria? Is it:\n\nSpecific?\nMeasurable?\nAchievable?\nRelevant?\nTime-bound?\n\nCan you think of ways to make this goal more realistic?\n\n\n\nImagining our future\nResearch (conducted at Plymouth) shows that having a clear mental image of your goals and the steps toward them helps maintain motivation.\nWe’re going to do a brief visualisation exercise to solidify the goals we just identified.\nINSERT JACKIE’S IMAGERY GUIDANCE RECORDING HERE. TUTORS CAN PLAY THE AUDIO FROM THEIR PHONE WITHOUT MESSING AROUND WITH THE AV EQUIPMENT\nDiscuss as a group\n\nwhat they will do this week to get started?\nwhat gives them confidence they can succeed at this?"
