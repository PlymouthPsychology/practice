  Dear [NAME],

  Sorry to miss you in our tutorial today. In the session we reviewed where people were at in their projects, and whether they were behind or ahead of schedule.
  
  You can complete part of the task for yourself, and there are notes on how to do that here: XXX

  I hope to see you in our next tutorial session.

  All the best,

  [YOUR NAME]

# Projects and project management

 
This tutorial will help students understand how much progress they have made on their project, and what still needs to be done.

The teaching materials will be based on Andy's existing Stage 4 project package, which covers project management and Gantt charts. 

Check back soon for details.
