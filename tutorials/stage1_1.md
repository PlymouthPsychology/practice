# Tutor Handout – First Tutorial  
**Using psychology to learn psychology**

This is based on a practice task here: XXXURL



## Aims
- Build group familiarity 
- Set tutorial norms
- Model how psychology moves from hunches to evidence
- Discuss what makes *good evidence*.  
- Practise concise evidence summary writing
- Each student commit to reflect on study habits and commit to a note-taking plan



## Opening
- **Introductions**: Go round – name, where from. As them to think of one non-psychology interest BUT KEEP TO THEMSELVES FOR A MOMENT.

- **Housekeeping**: how tutorials run, attendance, resources, how to ask for help.  



## Warm-up: Pictionary

**Purpose:** icebreaker + illustrate a speed/accuracy tradeoff

**Setup:**  
- Two teams (~4 per team)
- Timed games (suggest 60sec)
- Each student draws a hobby/interest
- Teammates guess; 1 point per correct guess. 
- Rotate


**Debrief**  

- Tally up the scores and celebrate!

- Ask: “When you guessed, what made you confident enough to shout out?” Did some students have a hunch, but kept quiet? 

- Foreshadow: Mention this kind of speed/accuracy tradeoff is common. XXX WHERE IN STAGE 1 ... PETER??

- Link: balancing speed vs accuracy is a bit like deciding when we have *enough evidence* in psychology. 


## Core Question

*How should students take lecture notes—handwritten or typed?*  

**Briefly**: Open a discussion on whether people used handwritten or typed notes for a-level.

**Prompt:** Note that we already have opinions. Today's activity is to look at one study, and ask: "is the evidence strong enough to change our our mind, or our behaviour?"


## Study Snapshot

- Handout the Mueller & Oppenheimer, 2014 excerpt. Make it clear it's not the whole paper.


**Instructions:**  Skim extract + figure and identify:  

- Who were participants?  
- What did they do?  
- What was measured?  
- What was found?

**[Answers]**  

- Princeton undergrads, randomised laptop vs longhand.  
- Watched 15-min TED talk, took notes “as usual.”  
- After 30 mins, *factual* and *conceptual* questions.  
- Results: 
    - factual ≈ same
    - **conceptual lower with laptops**


## How useful was the plot?

**Ask**: What did they learn by looking at the plot?

**Prompts**

- What is a z-score? If they don't know does it matter? Discuss how to read papers where they don't understand all the technical details.

- Where are the differences? Are they big enough to matter?  What do we mean by "matter"? How can we judge?

- Why might there be a difference, conceptual > factual? Can they think of topics from A-level which might be relevant here: In the UK syllabus they _could_ have covered:
    - Depth of processing and impact on memory: do laptops encourage shallow verbatim transcription vs. longhand → elaborative rehearsal?
    - Encoding specificity for retrieval cues: do handwritten notes create richer cues?
    

## How useful is this evidence?

**Prompts**

- Would you bet your exam results on this one study?
- What else would you want to know?


Tutor notes:  

- Design: study materials were lab TED talks, short delay, brief test (not real lectures/exams).

- Sample: 67 Princeton students for course credit.
  
-Mechanism? Maybe behaviour (verbatim vs generative) matters more than device (laptop/pen)?



## Application: Personal Plan
**Say:**  
“Based on this evidence, what will you try? Handwriting, laptop, or a mix—but add one rule that forces you to process, not just copy.”

Examples:  
- One-sentence summary per slide.  
- Cornell cues/questions.  
- Rewrite typed notes in own words after class.  
- Mind-map instead of linear copy.

**Task:** Each student writes a plan + an *if–then* rule:  
*“If I catch myself copying word-for-word, then I will pause and summarise in one sentence.”*

## Wrap-up
**Exit ticket (students write):**  
1. One change I’ll try next week, and why.  
2. One limitation of today’s evidence that stood out.  

**Say:**  
“Science helps us formalise judgements about when evidence is strong enough to act. Trial your plan for two weeks—we’ll see how well it works for you.”  

---

## Quick Fallback Lines
- *“I type faster.”* → “Speed helps capture, but understanding needs processing—add a generative step.”  
- *“Ban laptops?”* → “Evidence is mixed and banning raises equity issues. It’s about **how** you use tools.”  
- *“One study isn’t enough.”* → “Exactly—that’s why we need replication and to test what works for you.”
