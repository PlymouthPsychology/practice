## CONTEXT

Students were asked to identify and write **strong, specific limitations** for classic psychology studies.  
They practised distinguishing *generic* from *specific* critiques, and have now submitted short written limitations.  
PsyBot will give feedback on these.

Students should show that they understand:
- what the study was trying to demonstrate (and the limitation relates to that)
- which aspects of the design or method of the study might limit it's conclusions  
- *why* those aspects matter  
- how to use *tentative*, precise language to express critique

# Examples


## Peterson and Peterson (1959) - Short Term Memory

Peterson and Peterson (1959) investigated the duration of short-term memory. Participants were shown consonant trigrams (e.g., XQF) and asked to recall them after delays of 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, or 18 seconds. During the delay, participants counted backwards in threes from a given number (e.g., 397, 394, 391...) to prevent rehearsal. Recall dropped from about 80% at 3 seconds to less than 10% at 18 seconds.



## Godden and Baddeley (1975) - Context Dependent Memory

Godden and Baddeley (1975) tested context-dependent memory with deep-sea divers. Participants learned word lists either on land or underwater (10 feet deep), and were later tested in either the same or different environment. This created four conditions: learn-land/test-land, learn-land/test-water, learn-water/test-land, learn-water/test-water. Recall was approximately 40% better when learning and testing contexts matched.



## Baddeley (1966) - Acoustic and Semantic Similarity

Baddeley (1966) examined the effects of acoustic and semantic similarity on recall. Participants heard either acoustically similar words (man, cat, can, cap, mad) or acoustically dissimilar words (pit, few, cow, pen, sup), or semantically similar words (huge, big, great, large, wide) or semantically dissimilar words (good, huge, hot, safe, thin). They recalled them immediately or after a 20-minute delay. Acoustically similar words were harder to recall immediately; semantically similar words were harder to recall after delay.



## Ainsworth et al. (1970s) - Strange Situation

Ainsworth and colleagues (1970s) developed the 'Strange Situation' to assess infant attachment. They recruited families from the local area near Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. In the laboratory, infants (aged 12-18 months) were observed in an unfamiliar room during a series of brief episodes: the mother left the child with a stranger, returned, left again leaving the infant completely alone, then the stranger returned, and finally the mother returned. Researchers coded the infant's behaviour during separations and reunions. Based on their responses - particularly how quickly infants were comforted when the mother returned - Ainsworth classified attachment styles as secure (about 65%), avoidant (about 20%), or anxious-resistant (about 15%). She concluded these patterns reflected the quality of care infants had received at home.



## Harlow (1958) - Contact Comfort

Harlow (1958) investigated whether infant attachment is based on feeding or comfort. He separated infant rhesus monkeys from their biological mothers at birth and raised them in isolation with two artificial 'mother' surrogates. One surrogate was made of bare wire mesh with a bottle attached providing milk. The other was covered in soft terry cloth but provided no food. The researchers measured how much time infants spent with each surrogate and how they behaved when frightened (a mechanical toy was placed in the cage). Infant monkeys spent 15-18 hours per day clinging to the cloth mother and only 1 hour with the wire mother (just to feed). When frightened, they ran to the cloth mother for comfort. Harlow concluded that 'contact comfort' is more important than feeding for attachment bonds.



## Educational Media and Infant Development

Researchers in the early 2000s investigated whether educational media could enhance infant cognitive development. Parents of infants aged 12-18 months were surveyed about their child's media use and completed vocabulary checklists (reporting how many words their infant could say or understand). The study found that infants whose parents reported more time watching educational DVDs (products marketed as 'Baby Einstein', 'Brainy Baby', etc.) had larger vocabularies than infants who watched less. The researchers concluded that educational media could support early language development, and these findings were widely publicised. The Baby Einstein company grew rapidly, marketing products as educational tools.

### WEAK vs STRONG LIMITATIONS — examples

<instruction>
Use these examples as reference when judging the student’s work.
There are many other limitations that could have been written, though, so don't limit yourself when evaluating their work.
</instruction>


**Peterson & Peterson (1959) — Short-term memory**
- Weak: “Artificial task, lacks ecological validity.”  
- Strong: “Consonant trigrams have no semantic meaning; everyday memory often involves meaningful material and elaborative strategies, so the rapid forgetting found here may not generalise to meaningful information.”

**Godden & Baddeley (1975) — Context-dependent memory**
- Weak: “Only used divers, can’t generalise.”  
- Strong: “Land vs underwater represents an extreme context shift; the effect might be smaller for more typical context changes (like classrooms), so generalisation to everyday recall is uncertain.”

**Baddeley (1966) — Acoustic and Semantic Similarity**
- Weak: “People don’t memorise word lists in real life.”  
- Strong: “Word lists isolate similarity effects but may not reflect how semantic overlap influences recall in stories or natural speech where contextual cues aid retrieval.”

**Ainsworth (1970) — Strange Situation**
- Weak: “Might not generalise to other places.”  
- Strong: “Brief lab separations may not reflect real-world attachment behaviours; in cultures valuing independence, infant responses might carry different meanings.”

**Harlow (1958) — Contact comfort**
- Weak: “Used monkeys not humans.”  
- Strong: “Prolonged isolation likely produced distress beyond normal conditions; preference for cloth may reflect stress responses rather than typical attachment. Unclear whether binary wire/cloth choice models human attachment accurately.”

**‘Baby Einstein’ study — Correlation**
- Weak: “Just a correlation.”  
- Strong: “Parents who buy educational media may differ systematically (e.g., talk more to their children, have higher income or education), so correlations may reflect pre-existing differences rather than media effects.”



# THE STUDENT’S WORK

<instruction>
Now, read the student’s limitation carefully. Look for examples of the problems above.  
Have they made their critique specific and reasoned? Or is it still generic or vague?  
We will give them feedback below.

# FEEDBACK TASK

¡BEGIN

How has the student improved compared to a generic A-level-style limitation?  

In abbreviated notes: make a list of everything they did well (if any).  
Focus on improvements we *know* were needed — specificity, explanation, appropriate tone, etc.

[[improvements]]

What is the best or most obvious improvement?  
Expand in a few sentences with short examples or quotes.

[[bestthing]]


¡OBLIVIATE

Are there weaknesses or missed opportunities in the student's work? 
Are the limitation still too generic or vague?
In abbreviated notes: list what they could improve (if any).

[[tofix]]

Pick the one issue that would most improve their writing overall (clarity, precision, specificity).  
Explain why, in a few short sentences.

[[toptip]]


¡OBLIVIATE

We read their work, and now we are summarising our notes to give the student feedback.

<feedback so far>

#### things they did well:

</feedback so far>


Now, in no more than two paragraphs, write short feedback for the student directly.  
Focus on what they did well and what could be improved.  
Include brief illustrative phrases (with ellipses).  
Tone should be neutral to slightly positive — clear, simple, and encouraging.
