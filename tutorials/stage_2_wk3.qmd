  Dear [tutee],

  Sorry to miss you in our tutorial today. In the session we explored how to connect your core values with your career planning and daily actions.

  We worked through identifying your most important values and thinking about how different psychology career paths might align with what matters most to you. The goal was to help you make more intentional decisions about how you spend your time and energy.

  You can complete the values exercise and reflection task yourself using the materials here: [link to growth-goals-career-planning task]

  I hope to see you in our next tutorial session.

  All the best,

  YOUR NAME

# Session Overview

This tutorial helps students connect their core values to their career planning and daily actions. 

Students often struggle to see how their current studies link to future goals; this session provides a practical framework for values-based decision making, and setting SMART goals for the next weeks and months.

It starts with an icebreaker: We use the things that most frustrate/anger us to identify what matters most (core values).




# Introduction

Welcome students

Explain that today's session focuses on **values-based career planning**. 

Many students feel overwhelmed by career choices or disconnected from their daily actions. 

This session will help identify what truly matters to them, and use these insights to guide their activity.



### Ice Breaker: Using Outrage for Good!

These days, everyone seems angry about something.

Rather than dismissing that anger, let's use it. 

Our strongest frustrations sometimes point to the values that matter most to us.


**Prompt students**

- Think back over the past year. 
- What are 2–3 things that really annoyed you — moments when you felt genuinely frustrated or outraged? 
- They don’t have to be "serious"; it could be anything from climate inaction to people jumping queues. 

**Discuss in pairs** Share examples with the person next to you. Perhaps 3-4 minutes

**As a group** Invite 2–3 volunteers (min) to share examples. 

**Prompt reflection** 

- What do these annoyances reveal about what you actually care for? 

- For example, if stealing milk from the fridge drives you mad, perhaps you really value respect or honesty?

- If online misinformation winds you up, maybe you care deeply about truth and accuracy? 

**Discuss in pairs again** ~3-4 minutes again

**As a group again** Share what the students think 



# Values Discovery


**Open the list of values**

- Direct students to the [long list of values here](list-of-values.html), or scan this QR code to open the list on a phone:

**Instructions**:

1. Quickly scan and select all values that resonate with them (2-3 mins)
    - Check they have all highlighted at least 7 values, preferably more

2. Second pass (1-2 minutes): Narrow down to exactly 7 values

3. Final check: Note any important values not on the list? 


**Tutor notes:** 

- Help students who seem stuck.
- Remind them there are no right or wrong answers.



**Sharing values** 

- Individuals or pairs share their 7 values
- Notice any patterns in your group? Any surprising differences?


# Ranking values

**Instructions**

- Students rank their 7 values in order of importance and 
- Identify their top 3 core values. 


**Pair Discussion**

Students share their top 3 values with a partner, discussing:

- Why these values matter most to them
- Any challenges in narrowing down to just 3
- How/why it should influence their choices of career, and their activities in daily life.


# Values and careers

**Discussion**

- Ask all students what career plans they have (if any)? Go around the group to share.

- Remind them that there are good psychology-specific resources on the [Prospects website](https://www.prospects.ac.uk/careers-advice/what-can-i-do-with-my-degree/psychology)


**For each career path you're considering:**

- Which of your core values would this work fulfil?
- What values might be compromised?
- How well does this align with who you are?



# Values and *goals*

Our values only influence our lives if they guide what we do each day. 

**Instructions**

- Take your top 3 core values.

- For each value, brainstorm 1-2 possible goals that would help you live that value out in practice.
    - Example: If one of your top values is Creativity, a goal might be "Find a dissertation topic that allows me to have input on the design of the study" or "Join a student society that lets me make art/music."
    - If your value is Justice, a goal might be "Apply for a placement or volunteer in an organisation focused on advocacy or policy change"

- Now choose one goal per value that feels most realistic and motivating right now.

- Turn each one into a SMART goal: It must be **Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound**.
    - Example: “By the end of this term, I will attend two careers events to explore organisations working on mental health equity.”


**Pair Discussion**

- Share one of your SMART goals with your partner.
- Ask: Does this goal clearly reflect the underlying value? 
- Does it meet the SMART criteria? Is it:
    - Specific? 
    - Measurable? 
    - Achievable? 
    - Relevant? 
    - Time-bound?
- Can you think of ways to make this goal more realistic?


# Imagining our future

Research ([conducted at Plymouth](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/research/psychology/applied-psychology/functional-imagery-training)) shows that having a clear mental image of your goals and the steps toward them helps maintain motivation. 

We're going to do a brief visualisation exercise to solidify the goals we just identified.

**Discuss as a group**

- what they will do this week to get started?
- what gives them confidence they can succeed at this?
