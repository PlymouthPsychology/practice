  Dear [tutee],

  Sorry to miss you in our tutorial today. In the session we explored how to connect your core values with your career planning and daily actions.

  We worked through identifying your most important values and thinking about how different psychology career paths might align with what matters most to you. The goal was to help you make more intentional decisions about how you spend your time and energy.

  You can complete the values exercise and reflection task yourself using the materials here: [link to growth-goals-career-planning task]

  I hope to see you in our next tutorial session.

  All the best,

  YOUR NAME

# Session Overview

This tutorial helps students connect their core values to their career planning and daily actions. 

Students often struggle to see how their current studies link to future goals; this session provides a practical framework for values-based decision making, and setting SMART goals for the next weeks and months.

It starts with an icebreaker: We use the things that most frustrate/anger us to identify what matters most (core values).




# Introduction

Welcome students

Explain that today's session focuses on **values-based career planning**. 

Many students feel overwhelmed by career choices or disconnected from their daily actions. 

This session will help identify what truly matters to them, and use these insights to guide their activity.



# 1. Ice Breaker

## Using Outrage for Good!

These days, everyone seems angry about something.

Rather than dismissing that anger, let's use it. 

Our strongest frustrations sometimes point to the values that matter most to us.


**Prompt students**

- Over the past year...
- What 2–3 things that really annoyed you?
- Moments when you felt genuinely frustrated or outraged? 
- Don’t have to be "serious"; anything from climate inaction to queue jumping. 

**Discuss in pairs** Share examples with the person next to you. Perhaps 3-4 minutes

**As a group** Invite 2–3 volunteers (min) to share examples. 

**Prompt reflection** 

- What do these annoyances reveal about what you actually care for? 

- For example, if stealing milk from the fridge drives you mad, perhaps you really value *respect* or *honesty*?

- If online misinformation winds you up, maybe you care deeply about *truth* and *accuracy*? 

**As a group**  Invite discussion about what their annoyances reveal.



# 2. Values Discovery


Direct students to the [long list of values here](list-of-values.html), or scan this QR code to open the list on a phone:

![](../images/qr_values.png){width=80%}


**Instructions for students, individually**:

1. Quickly scan and select all values that resonate with them (2-3 mins)
    - Check they have all highlighted at least 7 values, preferably more

2. Second pass (1-2 minutes): Narrow down to exactly 7 values

3. Final check: Note any important values not on the list? 



If students are stuck, remind them there are no right or wrong answers.



**As a group** 

- Individuals or pairs share their 7 values they identified

Once everyone has shared?

- Notice any patterns in your group? 
- Any surprises/conflicts?

- If we had to pick our the top 3 values, what would they be?
- Why do these values matter most to us?



# 3. Values and careers

**As a group**

- Ask each student what career plans they have (if any)? 
- Go around the group to share plans...


Students are likely to be unsure/vague on plans. Remind them about good psychology-specific resources on the [Prospects website](https://www.prospects.ac.uk/careers-advice/what-can-i-do-with-my-degree/psychology)


**Discuss in pairs**:  "For each career path you are considering..."

- Which of your core values (especially the 'top 3') would this work fulfil? How/why?
- What values might be compromised or in conflict?


**Prompt reflection** 

- Had students considered _why_ particular career paths appealed to them?
- Could thinking about their values help as they research careers?



# 4. Values and *goals*

Career choices and jobs might feel quite distant. But our values can only influence our lives if they guide what we do **each day**. 

In this part we try and find more immediate goals that serve our values (and help us move towards careers that align with them).


**Discussion in pairs**

- Take turns with your partner
- Recap your **top 3** core values, the ones most important to you.

- For each value, brainstorm 1-2 possible **goals** that would help you live that value out in practice.
    - Example: If one of your top values is Creativity, a goal might be "Find a dissertation topic that allows me to have input on the design of the study" or "Join a student society that lets me make art/music."
    - If your value is Justice, a goal might be "Apply for a placement or volunteer in an organisation focused on advocacy or policy change"


**As a group**

- Elicit some examples of goals


**Further discussion in pairs**:

- "Choose one goal per value that feels most realistic and motivating right now"

- Turn each one into a SMART goal: It must be **Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound**.
    - Example: “By the end of this term, I will attend two careers events to explore organisations working on mental health equity.”

- Ask your partner: Does this goal clearly link to the value? If not, explain the link to them.

- Is the goal SMART? That is,
    - Specific? 
    - Measurable? 
    - Achievable? 
    - Relevant? 
    - Time-bound?


# 5. Imagining our future

Research ([conducted at Plymouth](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/research/psychology/applied-psychology/functional-imagery-training)) shows that having a clear mental image of your goals and the steps toward them helps maintain motivation. 

We're going to do a brief visualisation exercise to solidify the goals we just identified.

**Discuss as a group**

- what they will do this week to get started?
- what gives them confidence they can succeed at this?
