  Dear [tutee],

  Sorry to miss you in our tutorial today. In the session we explored how to connect your core values with your career planning and daily actions.

  We worked through identifying your most important values and thinking about how different psychology career paths might align with what matters most to you. The goal was to help you make more intentional decisions about how you spend your time and energy.

  You can complete the values exercise and reflection task yourself using the materials here: [link to growth-goals-career-planning task]

  I hope to see you in our next tutorial session.

  All the best,

  YOUR NAME

# Session Overview

This tutorial helps students connect their core values to their career planning and daily actions. 


Students often struggle to see how their current studies link to future goals; this session provides a practical framework for values-based decision making, and setting SMART goals for the next weeks and months.

It starts with an icebreaker: We use the things that most frustrate/anger us to identify what matters most (core values).



# Session Structure

### Introduction (3 minutes)

Welcome students

Explain that today's session focuses on values-based career planning. 

Many students feel overwhelmed by career choices or disconnected from their daily actions. 

This session helps them identify what truly matters to them and use these insights to guide decisions.



### Ice Breaker: Using Outrage for Good! (7 minutes)

**Tutor guidance**: These days, everyone seems angry about something — from big global issues to trivial internet spats. 

Rather than dismissing that anger, let's use it. Our strongest frustrations sometimes point to the values that matter most to us.


**Instructions**

- Think back over the past year. What are 2–3 things that really annoyed you — moments when you felt genuinely frustrated or outraged? 

- They don’t have to be serious; it could be anything from climate inaction to people cutting in queues. Share one example with the person next to you.

**Discuss in pairs** Perhaps 3-4 minutes

**As a group** Invite 2–3 volunteers (min) to share examples. 

**Prompt reflection** Outrage can be a shortcut to finding what matters most.

- What do these annoyances reveal about what you actually care about? 
- For example, if lateness drives you mad, perhaps you really value respect or reliability?  If online arguments over misinformation wind you up, maybe you care deeply about truth and accuracy? 


**Discuss in pairs again** ~3-4 minutes again

**As a group again** Share what the students think 



## Values Discovery (15 minutes)

### Individual Values Selection (8 minutes)
Direct students to the comprehensive values list (available as handout or digital version). Ask them to:

1. **First pass (3 minutes):** Quickly scan and circle values that immediately resonate
2. **Second pass (3 minutes):** Narrow down to exactly 7 values
3. **Final selection (2 minutes):** Add any important values not on the list

**Tutor guidance:** Circulate and help students who seem stuck. Remind them there are no right or wrong answers.

### Small Group Sharing (7 minutes)
Groups of 3-4 students share their 7 values. Each person has 1-2 minutes to explain why they chose particular values.

**Discussion prompt:** "Notice any patterns in your group? Any surprising differences?"

---

## Core Values Identification (12 minutes)

### Individual Ranking (5 minutes)
Students rank their 7 values in order of importance and identify their top 3 core values. For each core value, they write one sentence explaining its importance and how it should influence their choices.

### Pair Discussion (7 minutes)
Students share their top 3 values with a partner, discussing:
- Why these values matter most to them
- How these might influence career decisions
- Any challenges in narrowing down to just 3

---

## Career Exploration & Alignment (15 minutes)

### Careers Information Input (5 minutes)
**Tutor guidance:** Provide brief overview of psychology career paths and direct students to resources.

"Before we explore alignment, let's ensure everyone knows their options. Psychology careers include clinical, educational, research, business/organisational, forensic, health psychology, and many others. If you're unsure about specific paths, check out the [BPS careers website](https://www.bps.org.uk/careers-education/careers) or your university careers service."

### Values-Career Alignment Activity (10 minutes)
Students work individually (5 minutes) then in pairs (5 minutes) to consider:

**For each career path you're considering:**
- Which of your core values would this work fulfil?
- What values might be compromised?
- How well does this align with who you are?

**Tutor guidance:** Encourage honest reflection. Some students may discover misalignments - this is valuable learning.

## Imagery and Goal Visualisation (5 minutes)

**Tutor guidance:** This incorporates Jackie's functional imagery training suggestion.

"Research shows that having a clear mental image of your goals and the steps toward them helps maintain motivation. We're going to do a brief visualisation exercise."

Guide students through imagery:
1. "Close your eyes and imagine yourself in 5 years, working in a role that aligns with your core values"
2. "Picture a typical day - what are you doing? Who are you helping? How do you feel?"
3. "Now trace backwards - what steps brought you here? What did you do this year? This month? This week?"
4. "Open your eyes and jot down the key steps you visualised"

---

## Action Planning & Commitment (3 minutes)

Students identify:
- **Continue:** One thing they're currently doing that aligns with values and goals
- **Start:** One new action they'll take this week to move closer to their goals
- **Stop:** One activity or habit they'll stop because it doesn't serve their values

**Tutor guidance:** Encourage specific, achievable actions for the "start" item.

# Wrap-up and Reflection Assignment

**In tutorial:** Students share their weekly action commitment with one other person as accountability.

**Follow-up task:** Students create a voice note or written reflection (2-3 minutes) including:
1. Their top 3 core values and why they matter
2. How this exercise clarified or changed their career thinking
3. Their specific weekly action plan
4. What gives them confidence they can succeed

They submit this to PsyBot for feedback on values-career connections and action plan practicality.

# Materials Needed

- Values list handouts (or digital access)
- BPS careers information or links
- PsyBot submission link
- Timer for activities

# Tutor Notes

**Common challenges:**
- Students overwhelmed by choice - remind them values evolve and this isn't permanent
- Perfectionism in values selection - emphasise exploration over getting it "right"
- Vague career knowledge - direct to specific resources and encourage careers service appointments

**Extension activities if time allows:**
- Discuss how values might change over time
- Explore how different contexts (work, relationships, personal time) might prioritise different values

**Key learning outcomes:**
- Students can identify their core values
- Students understand connection between values and career satisfaction
- Students have concrete weekly action plan
- Students recognise importance of ongoing reflection and adjustment
