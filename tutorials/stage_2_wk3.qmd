# Session Overview

This tutorial helps students connect their core values to their career planning and daily actions. 

Students often struggle to see how their current studies link to future goals; this session provides a practical framework for values-based decision making, and setting SMART goals for the next weeks and months.

It starts with an icebreaker: We use the things that most frustrate/anger us to identify what matters most (core values).




# Introduction

Welcome students

Explain that today's session focuses on **values-based career planning**. 

Many students feel overwhelmed by career choices or disconnected from their daily actions. 

This session will help identify what truly matters to them, and use these insights to guide their activity.



# 1. Ice Breaker

## Using Outrage for Good!

These days, everyone seems angry about something.

Rather than dismissing that anger, let's use it. 

Our strongest frustrations sometimes point to the values that matter most to us.


**Prompt students**

- Over the past year...
- What 2–3 things that really annoyed you?
- Moments when you felt genuinely frustrated or outraged? 
- Don’t have to be "serious"; anything from climate inaction to queue jumping. 

**Discuss in pairs** Share examples with the person next to you. Perhaps 3-4 minutes

**As a group** Invite 2–3 volunteers (min) to share examples. 

**Prompt reflection** 

- What do these annoyances reveal about what you actually care for? 

- For example, if stealing milk from the fridge drives you mad, perhaps you really value *respect* or *honesty*?

- If online misinformation winds you up, maybe you care deeply about *truth* and *accuracy*? 

**As a group**  Invite discussion about what their annoyances reveal.



# 2. Values Discovery


Direct students to the [long list of values here](list-of-values.html), or scan this QR code to open the list on a phone:

![](../images/qr_values.png){width=80%}


**Instructions for students, individually**:

1. Quickly scan and select all values that resonate with them (2-3 mins)
    - Check they have all highlighted at least 7 values, preferably more

2. Second pass (1-2 minutes): Narrow down to exactly 7 values

3. Final check: Note any important values not on the list? 



If students are stuck, remind them there are no right or wrong answers.



**As a group** 

- Individuals or pairs share their 7 values they identified

Once everyone has shared?

- Notice any patterns in your group? 
- Any surprises/conflicts?

- If we had to pick our the top 3 values, what would they be?
- Why do these values matter most to us?



# 3. Values and careers

**As a group**

- Ask each student what career plans they have (if any)? 
- Go around the group to share plans...


Students are likely to be unsure/vague on plans. Remind them about good psychology-specific resources on the [Prospects website](https://www.prospects.ac.uk/careers-advice/what-can-i-do-with-my-degree/psychology)


**Discuss in pairs**:  "For each career path you are considering..."

- Which of your core values (especially the 'top 3') would this work fulfil? How/why?
- What values might be compromised or in conflict?


**Prompt reflection** 

- Had students considered _why_ particular career paths appealed to them?
- Could thinking about their values help as they research careers?



# 4. Values and *goals*

Career choices and jobs might feel quite distant. But our values can only influence our lives if they guide what we do **each day**. 

In this part we try and find more immediate goals that serve our values (and help us move towards careers that align with them).


**Discussion in pairs**

- Take turns with your partner
- Recap your **top 3** core values, the ones most important to you.

- For each value, brainstorm 1-2 possible **goals** that would help you live that value out in practice.
    - Example: If one of your top values is Creativity, a goal might be "Find a dissertation topic that allows me to have input on the design of the study" or "Join a student society that lets me make art/music."
    - If your value is Justice, a goal might be "Apply for a placement or volunteer in an organisation focused on advocacy or policy change"


**As a group**

- Elicit some examples of goals


**Further discussion in pairs**:

- "Choose one goal per value that feels most realistic and motivating right now"

- Turn each one into a SMART goal: It must be **Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound**.
    - Example: "By the end of this term, I will attend two careers events to explore organisations working on mental health equity."

- Ask your partner: Does this goal clearly link to the value? If not, explain the link to them.

- Is the goal SMART? That is,
    - Specific? 
    - Measurable? 
    - Achievable? 
    - Relevant? 
    - Time-bound?


# 5. Imagining our future

Research ([conducted at Plymouth](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/research/psychology/applied-psychology/functional-imagery-training)) shows that having a clear mental image of your goals and the steps toward them helps maintain motivation. 

We're going to do a brief visualisation exercise to solidify the goals we just identified.


<!-- 

Close your eyes, take a breath, relax. 

Recall your goal. Remember that you chose it so that you would know when you had achieved it, and that it was achievable.

Imagine taking the first few steps towards your goal -- doing something today, or in the next few days, to work on your plan. 

Some actions will be small — perhaps sending an email or reading a web page. Others will involve more steps — perhaps contacting someone, making a call, or a meeting in person. Some steps will be quick, and others will take longer.

Picture yourself in the moment, actively working towards your goal. Where are you? What is around you? What do you see?

Now, play forward several weeks or even a month.  
Notice how you feel to have made a start.

Imagine yourself during this period, working on your plan successfully. 
Use all your senses to make it vivid and real. 
Notice any small things that are getting better in these first days and weeks of work.  

How do you feel in yourself? 

Play forward to the future, perhaps even several months away. 
You have achieved your goal. Notice where you are, what you can hear, what is around you. What has changed?  Imagine how you feel in yourself. 

Take a minute to enjoy a feeling of success and accomplishment.
And when you are ready, open your eyes and take a deep breath.

**Discuss as a group**

- how vivid was the imagery they created?
- what they will do this week to get started?
- what gives them confidence they can succeed at this?
