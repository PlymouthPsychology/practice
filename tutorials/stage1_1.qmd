This is based on a [practice task here](../tasks/studying-using-psychology-to-be-better-psychologist.html)



## Aims

- Build group familiarity 
- Set tutorial norms

- Model how psychology helps move from hunches --> evidence
- Discuss what makes *good evidence*.  
- Practise concise writing

- Reflect on study habits
- Commit to a note-taking plan



## Introductions

- **Introductions**: Go round – name, where from. As them to think of one non-psychology interest BUT KEEP TO THEMSELVES FOR A MOMENT.

- **Housekeeping**: how tutorials run, attendance, resources, how to ask for help.  



## Warm-up: Pictionary

> Icebreaker task illustrates a speed/accuracy tradeoff


**Setup:**  

- Two teams (~4 per team)
- Timed games (suggest 60sec)
- Each student draws a hobby/interest
- Teammates guess; 1 point per correct guess. 
- Rotate


**Debrief**  

- Tally up the scores and celebrate!
- Ask: “When you guessed, what made you confident enough to shout out?” Did some students have a hunch, but kept quiet? 
- Foreshadow: Mention this kind of speed/accuracy tradeoff is common. XXX WHERE IN STAGE 1 ... PETER??

- Make the link: balancing speed vs accuracy is somewhat like deciding when we have *enough evidence* (i.e. in psychology). 


## A question we want to answer

> How should students take lecture notes—handwritten or typed?

**Disucss**: did students use handwritten or typed notes for A-level?

**Prompt:** We/they already have opinions. Today's we look at an experimental study and ask: **"is this evidence strong enough to change our our mind, or our behaviour?"**


## Study Snapshot


**Handout** the Mueller & Oppenheimer, 2014 excerpt. Make it clear it's not the whole paper.

**Briefly** give time for students to skim the extract and figure.

**Questions for students**:

- Who were the participants?  
- What did they do?  
- What was measured?  
- What was found?


**[Answers]**  

- Princeton undergrads
- Randomised laptop vs longhand
- Watched 15-min TED talk, took notes “as usual.”  
- After 30 mins, given *factual* and *conceptual* questions.
- Results: 
    - factual ≈ same performance
    - **conceptual  = lower performnce with laptops vs notes**


## How useful was the plot?

**Discuss**: What did the students learn by looking at the plot?

**Prompts**

- What is a z-score? If they don't know does it matter? Discuss how to read papers where they don't understand all the technical details.

- Where are the differences? Are they big enough to matter?  What do we mean by "matter"? How can we judge?

- Why might there be a difference, conceptual > factual? Can they think of topics from A-level which might be relevant here: In the UK syllabus they _could_ have covered:
    - Depth of processing and impact on memory: do laptops encourage shallow verbatim transcription vs. longhand → elaborative rehearsal?
    - Encoding specificity for retrieval cues: do handwritten notes create richer cues?
    

## How good and useful is this evidence? Should we change our habits?

**Discuss**

- Would you bet your exam results on this one study?
- What else would you want to know?


**Decide** 

- "Based on this evidence, what will you try over the next few weeks?
- Handwriting, laptop, or a mix?


**Suggest**

There are practice tasks on this site to encourage students to 

- [Make better notes](../tasks/studying-note-taking.html)
- [Check how good their notes are](../tasks/studying-using-your-notes.html)



## Wrap-up

**Go around all students. They need to answer**  

1. What change (if any) they will make next week, and why.  
2. One limitation of today’s evidence that stood out to them.



**Remind**

- Regular Monday briefings help them stay on track
