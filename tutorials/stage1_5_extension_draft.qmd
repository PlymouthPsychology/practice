# Part 3: Spotting weak critiques

**Goal:** Help students distinguish between generic and specific critical analysis.

**Topic:** Identifying weak vs strong critiques of research findings.

## Materials

![QR code for critique examples](../images/qr_critique_examples.png){width=50%}

## Procedure

**Show students the QR code or handout**

- This shows 8 research findings with different critiques
- Each example shows a study result followed by a limitation statement

**Explain the task:**

Students will see pairs of critiques on the same study. Their job is to:
- Decide which critiques are **generic** (could apply to almost any study) vs **specific** (identifies particular features that matter)
- Decide which are **weak** vs **strong**

**In pairs (5 minutes):**

- Students read through the examples
- **For each pair:** Which critique is stronger? Why?
- Mark their choices

**Whole group discussion:**

**Start with Examples 1 & 2** (Loftus & Palmer):

- Which critique did you prefer? Why?
- **Key point:** The weak one says "lacks ecological validity because videos not real accidents" - but the study is about how *question wording* affects memory, not about car accidents specifically. Using videos doesn't undermine that conclusion.
- **Strong version:** Identifies *what* might matter (emotional involvement) and *why* (might interact with suggestibility).

**Move through remaining examples** (select 2-3 more based on time):

**Examples 3 & 4** (Milgram):
- Weak: "Can't generalise, only American men" - stock phrase, doesn't explain why gender/nationality would matter for obedience
- Strong: Identifies specific context features (scientific authority, lab) and why they might create unique demand characteristics

**Examples 5 & 6** (Craik & Tulving):
- Weak: "People don't learn word lists" - misses the point about testing general memory principles
- Strong: Questions whether the principle scales to connected prose where processing works differently

**Examples 7 & 8** (Asch):
- Weak: Generic complaint about sample size
- Strong: Identifies features (face-to-face, unambiguous task) that might influence effect size

**Key points:**

- **Generic critiques** are swappable - you could say them about any study
- **Specific critiques** identify *which* aspect of the method might limit *which* conclusion
- **Strong critiques** explain *why* the limitation matters
- Notice the *language* in strong critiques: "may differ in important ways", "it's unclear whether", "could influence" - acknowledging uncertainty rather than dismissing findings


**Link to assessment:** When you write discussion sections, generic critiques don't earn marks, only strong specific ones.

# Part 4: Writing better limitations

**Goal:** Practice writing specific, thoughtful limitations rather than generic ones.

**Topic:** Moving from A-level style critiques to university-level critical analysis.

## Materials

[Study descriptions for critical analysis](stage1_study_scenarios.html) (handout or QR code below)

![QR code for study scenarios](../images/qr_study_scenarios.png){width=50%}

## Procedure

**Introduce the task:**

"You're going to practice writing limitations as you would in a discussion section. Each study description includes enough methodological detail to identify real, specific limitations."

**Explain the contrast:**

- At A-level, you might have written: "Small sample, lacks ecological validity, can't generalise"
- At university, you need to explain: What aspect of the method limits which conclusion? Why does it matter?

**In pairs (10 minutes):**

**Assign different studies to different pairs** (you have 8 options - select 2-4 based on group size and interests):
- Study A: Peterson & Peterson (short-term memory)
- Study B: Godden & Baddeley (context-dependent memory - divers)
- Study C: Baddeley (acoustic vs semantic similarity)
- Study D: Bartlett (War of the Ghosts)
- Study E: Ainsworth (Strange Situation attachment)
- Study F: Harlow (monkey attachment)
- Study G: Baby Einstein / educational media
- Study H: Zimbardo (Stanford Prison Experiment)

**For their assigned study:**
1. Discuss: What would you have written at A-level?
2. Now write 2-3 sentences identifying specific limitations
3. Focus on: What aspect of the method might limit which conclusion? Why does it matter?

**Whole group sharing:**

**Each pair shares** their study and limitations (1-2 minutes each)

**For each, discuss:**
- Did they avoid generic critiques?
- Did they identify specific methodological features?
- Did they explain why it matters?

**Example discussion points by study:**

**Study E (Ainsworth - Strange Situation):**
- Watch for: "Can't generalise to other cultures" (too generic)
- Better: "Brief lab separations may not reflect longer, real-world separations; behaviors might have different meanings in cultures with different independence values"
- Key: Identifying *what* about the method (brief, lab, specific behaviours) and *why* it matters

**Study F (Harlow - Monkeys):**
- Watch for: "Used animals not humans" (too generic)
- Better: "Compared two impoverished options (wire vs cloth) both lacking responsive interaction, which might be more important than physical contact in species with complex social communication"
- Key: Not rejecting the finding, but identifying what wasn't tested

**Study G (Baby Einstein):**
- Watch for: "Just a correlation" (too generic)
- Better: "Parents self-selected; those buying educational media likely differed in unmeasured ways (reading more, talking more). RCTs later found no benefit."
- Key: Identifying specific confounds and noting that better-designed studies contradicted the finding

**Study H (Zimbardo - Prison):**
- Watch for: "Unethical, artificial" (too generic)
- Better: "Zimbardo actively coached guards and set expectations; guards frequently asked what to do, suggesting demand characteristics rather than spontaneous role adoption"
- Key: This is a case where the methods genuinely undermine the conclusion

**Summary and link to assessment:**

"This is what 'good considerations of limitations' looks like in the PSYC421 marking criteria:
- Depth of insight into theoretical issues
- Critical analysis and assessment
- Specific, thoughtful analysis

You can find the full PSYC421 practical report mark scheme on the module DLE page. It rewards exactly this kind of thinking."

**Final question:**

"What's one thing from today you'll remember when writing your practical report discussion?"

## Notes for Tutors

**Time management:**
- Part 3: ~10-15 minutes
- Part 4: ~15-20 minutes
- Total: ~25-35 minutes for both activities

**Selecting studies for Part 4:**
- Pick studies that will interest your group
- Mix of memory (A-D) and social/developmental (E-H) works well
- Baby Einstein (G) and Zimbardo (H) are particularly engaging and show real-world impact of methods

**Key message throughout:**
- Not trying to dismiss findings
- Thinking about boundary conditions and what we can/can't conclude
- This is more sophisticated and useful than generic critiques
