# Session overview



This session gets students thinking critically about research. 

- In Task 1 they discuss a mock news item
- In Task 2 they interpret experimental data.


**Why these tasks matter:**

- Core critical thinking skills for PSYC421 research reports (especially the discussion section)
- Practice interpreting figures (they recently learned about distributions)

**Notes**:

- Hypothesis testing is introduced in week 5 (students may or may not have covered it yet).
- Correlations have not yet been taught (PSYC424, Semester 2), but should not be an obstacle for Task 1


# Task 1: Pop science

**Topic:** Reading a mock news item reporting a new study correlating chocolate consumption and happiness.


## Materials

[Chocolate and happiness study](stage1_chocolate_study.html) (handout or QR code below)

![QR code for chocolate study](../images/qr_chocolate_study.png){width=50%}

## Procedure

**Show students the QR code** 

- This links to a 'news' item which they can open on their phones
- Read the news item aloud to the group.

**Group discussion:**

- Would they believe this story? Why?
- Does it matter that it's about chocolate? 
- Do their prior beliefs play a role? What if it was about washing dishes?

**In small groups** (2-3 students):

- Read the method and results sections. 
- Students to discuss:
  - What are the limitations of this design?
  - What external factors could be confounded (i.e. influence both chocolate consumption and happiness)?
  - How would you design a study to show chocolate eating **causes** happiness?
  

**Whole group discussion:**

- Share ideas from the small groups
- Did the study details change their views?
- Lead discussion toward experimental design (chocolate as an independent variable)
- This sets up Task 2: interpreting experimental data


# Task 2: Drawing valid conclusions from experiments

**Goal:** Move beyond 'A-level' critiques of evidence (e.g., "study shows $x$ but it was done in 1972 so we should ignore it", or  "but these were just Plymouth students...")

**Key distinction:**

- What was observed (*the effect* exists), vs. 
- Why it happened (*the explanation*)


**Notes:**

Students often:

- reject effects because they can think of alternative explanations
- accept effects because they seem plausible (even when evidence doesn't support it)

This task is

-  ***not*** about replicability or statistical significance
- introduces *frequency distributions* (only covered in detail in next workshop, so give a gentle introduction here)


## Part 1: What influences memory?

**Ask students:** Which of the following statements do they agree with?

All other things being equal, how much a person is likely to remember about a recent event is influenced by: 

a) How old that person is
b) How drunk that person is
c) How much attention the person was paying
d) The learning style that person has
e) How unusual or important the event is

**Ask:** What other factors might influence memory?

- Generate 1-2 ideas in pairs, then share as a group

**Agree with them!** Generally you should agree with the students: many things can influence memory.

**Next:** Show Scenario 1. Students answer in pairs.



## Part 2: Scenarios

**Materials**

[Memory study scenarios](stage1_memory_scenarios.html) (handout or QR code below)

![QR code for memory scenarios](../images/qr_memory_scenarios.png){width=50%}


**Questions, for pairs of students** In the scenario, students are asked:

- What can you conclude from this study? 
- The should tick the boxes for conclusions they agree with. 


**Discussion**

- Get each pair to say what they agreed with. 
- Students often struggle and want to agree with most options


**Correct answer: (a) only.**

- Ask students if they can explain why this is the case?

**Notes**:


**Option b (best performing person used Method B...)** 

- Anecdotal evidence, not based on all data
- How psychologists draw conclusions vs media arguments
- E.g., "Richard Branson is successful, so copy him" or "My gran smoked and lived to 120"

**Option c (didn't control for other factors) or d (verbal learning style might influence...)**

- Factors that influence memory but irrelevant here because of **randomisation**
- Often agreed with; common error in student essays
- Ask: Can we ever control everything in psychology?

**Option e (study list wasn't unusual/important) or f (just Plymouth students)**  

- These are about generalisation.
- All studies happen somewhere, with some materials

- **Ask:** 

- Where would the study need to be run for you to believe it? 
- What materials would make the results more important? 


## Scenario 2

Ask students to consider Scenario 2.

- This is an example where people "believe" the outcome, so think the conclusion is valid.
- It is 'obvious' that people won't recall anything a year later,
- Consequently, many students will conclude that the study doesn't need to be run under different conditions. 

An alternative example (if preferred):

- Use a clearer mechanism 
- e.g., 100g chocolate raises blood sugar more than 100g rice-cakes
- Would that need replicating elsewhere? 
- Would it be important to test students in London as well as Plymouth?

Or make up your own example.





# Part 3: Spotting weak critiques

**Goal:** Help students distinguish between generic and specific critical analysis.

**Topic:** Identifying weak vs strong critiques of research findings.

## Materials

[Research critique examples](stage1_critique_examples.html) (handout or QR code below)

![QR code for critique examples](../images/qr_critique_examples.png){width=50%}

## Procedure

**Show students the QR code or handout**

- This shows 8 research findings with different critiques
- Each example shows a study result followed by a limitation statement

**Explain the task:**

Students will see pairs of critiques on the same study. Their job is to:
- Decide which critiques are **generic** (could apply to almost any study) vs **specific** (identifies particular features that matter)
- Decide which are **weak** vs **strong**

**In pairs (5 minutes):**

- Students read through the examples
- **For each pair:** Which critique is stronger? Why?
- Mark their choices

**Whole group discussion:**

**Start with Examples 1 & 2** (Loftus & Palmer):

- Which critique did you prefer? Why?
- **Key point:** The weak one says "lacks ecological validity because videos not real accidents" - but the study is about how *question wording* affects memory, not about car accidents specifically. Using videos doesn't undermine that conclusion.
- **Strong version:** Identifies *what* might matter (emotional involvement) and *why* (might interact with suggestibility).

**Move through remaining examples** (select 2-3 more based on time):

**Examples 3 & 4** (Milgram):
- Weak: "Can't generalise, only American men" - stock phrase, doesn't explain why gender/nationality would matter for obedience
- Strong: Identifies specific context features (scientific authority, lab) and why they might create unique demand characteristics

**Examples 5 & 6** (Craik & Tulving):
- Weak: "People don't learn word lists" - misses the point about testing general memory principles
- Strong: Questions whether the principle scales to connected prose where processing works differently

**Examples 7 & 8** (Asch):
- Weak: Generic complaint about sample size
- Strong: Identifies features (face-to-face, unambiguous task) that might influence effect size


---

**Key points:**

- **Generic critiques** are swappable - you could say them about any study
- **Specific critiques** identify *which* aspect of the method might limit *which* conclusion
- **Strong critiques** explain *why* the limitation matters


Notice the *language* in strong critiques: "may differ in important ways", "it's unclear whether", "could influence" --- acknowledging uncertainty rather than dismissing findings

**Link to assessment:** When you write discussion sections, generic critiques don't earn marks, only strong specific ones.


# Part 4: Writing better limitations

**Goal:** Practice writing specific, thoughtful limitations rather than generic ones.

**Topic:** Moving from A-level style critiques to university-level critical analysis.

## Materials

[Study descriptions for critical analysis](stage1_study_scenarios.html) (handout or QR code below)

![QR code for study scenarios](../images/qr_study_scenarios.png){width=50%}

## Procedure

**Introduce the task:**

"You're going to practice writing limitations as you would in a discussion section. Each study description includes enough methodological detail to identify real, specific limitations."

**Reiterate the differences between strong and weak critiques** Specific critiques identify *which* aspect of the method might limit *which* conclusion


**In pairs (10 minutes):**

- Assign different studies to different pairs
- They have 8 options - select 1 or 2 depending on time available

For their chosen example(s) they will

1. *Discuss*: What would you have written at A-level?
2. *Focus* on: What aspect of the method might limit which conclusion? Why does it matter?
3. *Write* 2-3 sentences identifying specific limitations


**Whole group sharing:**

- Each pair shares their study and limitations (1-2 minutes each)
- Did they avoid generic critiques?
- Did they identify specific methodological features?
- Did they explain why it matters?

#### Example discussion points for each study

**Ainsworth - Strange Situation**
- Weaker: "Might not generalise to other places" (too generic)
- Better: "Brief lab separations may not reflect longer, real-world separations; behaviors might have different meanings in cultures with different independence values"

**Baby Einstein**
- Watch for: "Just a correlation" (too generic)
- Better: "Parents self-selected; those buying educational media likely differed in unmeasured ways (e.g. reading/talking more to their children, having more free time and disposable income)."
- Key: Identifying specific potential confounds.

**Zimbardo - Prison**
- Watch for: "Unethical, artificial" (true but too generic)
- Better: "Zimbardo actively coached guards and set expectations; guards frequently asked what to do, suggesting demand characteristics rather than spontaneous role adoption"
- Key: This is a case where the methods genuinely undermine the conclusion



# Summary 

**Ask**

- What's one thing from today you'll remember when writing your practical report discussion?"


**Remind**

- You don't get credit for generic critiques, only strong specific ones
