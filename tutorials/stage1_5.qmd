  Dear [NAME],

  Sorry to miss you in our tutorial today. In the session we discussed critical thinking about research, including how to evaluate correlational studies and experimental findings.

  You can review the materials we covered here: https://plymouthpsychology.github.io/practice/tutorials/stage1_2.html

  I hope to see you in our next tutorial session.

  All the best,

  [YOUR NAME]

# Session overview



This session gets students thinking critically about research. 

- In Task 1 they discuss a mock news item
- In Task 2 they interpret experimental data.


**Why these tasks matter:**

- Core critical thinking skills for PSYC421 research reports (especially the discussion section)
- Practice interpreting figures (they recently learned about distributions)

**Notes**:

- Hypothesis testing is introduced in week 5 (students may or may not have covered it yet).
- Correlations have not yet been taught (PSYC424, Semester 2), but should not be an obstacle for Task 1


# Task 1: Pop science

**Topic:** Reading a mock news item reporting a new study correlating chocolate consumption and happiness.


## Materials

[Chocolate and happiness study](stage1_chocolate_study.html) (handout or QR code below)

![QR code for chocolate study](../images/qr_chocolate_study.png){width=50%}

## Procedure

**Show students the QR code** 

- This links to a 'news' item which they can open on their phones
- Read the news item aloud to the group.

**Group discussion:**

- Would they believe this story? Why?
- Does it matter that it's about chocolate? 
- Do their prior beliefs play a role? What if it was about washing dishes?

**In small groups** (2-3 students):

- Read the method and results sections. 
- Students to discuss:
  - What are the limitations of this design?
  - What external factors could be confounded (i.e. influence both chocolate consumption and happiness)?
  - How would you design a study to show chocolate eating **causes** happiness?
  

**Whole group discussion:**

- Share ideas from the small groups
- Did the study details change their views?
- Lead discussion toward experimental design (chocolate as an indepdent variable)
- This sets up Task 2: interpreting experimental data


# Task 2: Drawing valid conclusions from experiments

**Goal:** Move beyond 'A-level' critiques of evidence (e.g., "study shows $x$ but it was done in 1972 so we should ignore it", or  "but these were just Plymouth students...")

**Key distinction:**

- What was observed (*the effect* exists), vs. 
- Why it happened (*the explanation*)


**Notes:**

Students often:

- reject effects because they can think of alternative explanations
- accept effects because they seem plausible (even when evidence doesn't support it)

This task is

-  ***not*** about replicability or statistical significance
- links to Andy's critical thinking lectures
- introduces *frequency distributions* (only covered in detail in next workshop, so give a gentle introduction here)


## Part 1: What influences memory?

**Ask students:** Which of the following statements do they agree with?

All other things being equal, how much a person is likely to remember about a recent event is influenced by: 

a) How old that person is
b) How drunk that person is
c) How much attention the person was paying
d) The learning style that person has
e) How unusual or important the event is

**Ask:** What other factors might influence memory?

- Generate 1-2 ideas in pairs, then share as a group

**Agree with them!** Generally you should agree with the students: many things can influence memory.

**Next:** Show Scenario 1. Students answer in pairs.



## Part 2: Scenarios

**Materials**

[Memory study scenarios](stage1_memory_scenarios.html) (handout or QR code below)

![QR code for memory scenarios](../images/qr_memory_scenarios.png){width=50%}


**Questions, for pairs of students** In the scenario, students are asked:

- What can you conclude from this study? 
- The should tick the boxes for conclusions they agree with. 


**Discussion**

- Get each pair to say what they agreed with. 
- Students often struggle and want to agree with most options


**Correct answer: (a) only.**

- Ask students if they can explain why this is the case?

**Notes**:


**Option b (best performing person used Method B...)** 

- Anecdotal evidence, not based on all data
- How psychologists draw conclusions vs media arguments
- E.g., "Richard Branson is successful, so copy him" or "My gran smoked and lived to 120"

**Options c (didn't control for other factors) and d (verbal learning style might influence...)** 

- Factors that influence memory but irrelevant here because of **randomisation**
- Often agreed with; common error in student essays
- Ask: Can we ever control everything in psychology?

**Options e (study list wasn't unusual/important) and f (just Plymouth students)**  

- These are about generalisation.
- All studies happen somewhere, with some materials

- **Ask:** 

- Where would the study need to be run for you to believe it? 
- What materials would make the results more important? 


**Extension**

For more discussion, ask students to consider Scenario 2. 

- This is an example where people "believe" the outcome, so think the conclusion is valid.  
- It is 'obvious' that people won’t recall anything a year later, 
- Consequently, many students will conclude that the study doesn’t need to be run under different conditions. 

An alternative example (if preferred):

- Use a clearer mechanism 
- e.g., 100g chocolate raises blood sugar more than 100g rice-cakes
- Would that need replicating elsewhere? 
- Would it be important to test students in London as well as Plymouth?

Or make up your own example.
