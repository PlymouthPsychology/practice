# Session overview



This session gets students thinking critically about research.

- Task 1: Discuss a mock news item about a correlational study
- Task 2: Interpret experimental data and draw valid conclusions
- Task 3: Distinguish weak from strong critiques, and practice writing limitations

Aim to get through the tasks 1 and 2 by roughly half way through the session.


**Why these tasks matter:**

- Core critical thinking skills for PSYC421 research reports (especially the discussion section)
- Practice interpreting figures (they recently learned about distributions)
- Learn to write specific, thoughtful limitations rather than generic critiques

**Notes**:

- Hypothesis testing is introduced in week 5 (students may or may not have covered it yet).
- Correlations have not yet been taught (PSYC424, Semester 2), but should not be an obstacle for Task 1


# Task 1: Pop science

**Topic:** Reading a mock news item reporting a new study correlating chocolate consumption and happiness.


## Materials

[Chocolate and happiness study](stage1_chocolate_study.html) (handout or QR code below)

![QR code for chocolate study](../images/qr_chocolate_study.png){width=50%}

## Procedure

**Show students the QR code** 

- This links to a 'news' item which they can open on their phones
- Read the news item aloud to the group.

**Group discussion:**

- Would they believe this story? Why?
- Does it matter that it's about chocolate? 
- Do their prior beliefs play a role? What if it was about washing dishes?

**In small groups** (2-3 students):

- Read the method and results sections. 
- Students to discuss:
  - What are the limitations of this design?
  - What external factors could be confounded (i.e. influence both chocolate consumption and happiness)?
  - How would you design a study to show chocolate eating **causes** happiness?
  

**Whole group discussion:**

- Share ideas from the small groups
- Did the study details change their views?
- Lead discussion toward experimental design (chocolate as an independent variable)
- This sets up Task 2: interpreting experimental data


# Task 2: Drawing valid conclusions from experiments

**Goal:** Move beyond 'A-level' critiques of evidence (e.g., "study shows $x$ but it was done in 1972 so we should ignore it", or  "but these were just Plymouth students...")

**Key distinction:**

- What was observed (*the effect* exists), vs. 
- Why it happened (*the explanation*)


**Notes:**

Students often:

- *Reject* effects because they can think of alternative explanations
- *Accept* effects because they seem plausible (even when evidence doesn't support it)

<!-- This task is

-  ***not*** about replicability or statistical significance
 -->

## Part 1: What influences memory?

**Ask students:** Which of the following statements do they agree with?

> All other things being equal, how much a person is likely to remember about a recent event is influenced by: 
>
> a) How old that person is
> b) How drunk that person is
> c) How much attention the person was paying
> d) The learning style that person has
> e) How unusual or important the event is

**Ask:** What other factors might influence memory?

- Generate 1-2 ideas in pairs, then share as a group

**Agree with them!** Generally you should agree with the students: many things can influence memory.

**Next:** Show Scenario 1.



## Part 2: Scenarios

**Materials**

[Memory study scenarios](stage1_memory_scenarios.html) (handout or QR code below)

![QR code for memory scenarios](../images/qr_memory_scenarios.png){width=50%}


## Scenario 1

**Questions, for pairs of students**

- In the scenario, students are asked: What can you conclude from this study? 
- They should tick the boxes for conclusions they agree with (see linked page)


**Discussion**

- Get each pair to say what they agreed with. 
- Students often struggle and want to agree with most options


**Correct answer: (a) only.**

- Ask students if they can explain why this is the case?

**Notes**:


**Option b (best performing person used Method B...)** 

- Anecdotal evidence, not based on all data
- How psychologists draw conclusions vs media arguments
- E.g., "Richard Branson is successful, so copy him" or "My gran smoked and lived to 120"

**Option c (didn't control for other factors) or d (verbal learning style might influence...)**

- Factors that influence memory but irrelevant here because of **randomisation**
- Often agreed with; common error in student essays
- Ask: Can we ever control everything in psychology?

**Option e (study list wasn't unusual/important) or f (just Plymouth students)**  

- These are about generalisation.
- All studies happen somewhere, with some materials

**Ask:** 

- Where would the study need to be run for you to believe it? 
- What materials would make the results more important? 


## Scenario 2

Ask students to consider Scenario 2

- This compares recall immediately vs 1 year later.
- People "believe" the outcome, so think the conclusion is valid.
- It is 'obvious' that people won't recall anything a year later...
- Consequently, many students conclude that the study doesn't need to be run under different conditions. 
- Compare and contrast to scenario 1.


An alternative example (if preferred):

- Use a clearer mechanism 
- e.g., 100g chocolate raises blood sugar more than 100g rice-cakes
- Would that need replicating elsewhere? 
- Would it be important to test students in London as well as Plymouth?

Or make up your own example.





# Task 3: Critical analysis practice

**Goal:** Learn to distinguish generic critiques from specific, thoughtful ones, then practice writing your own.

**Topic:** Moving from A-level style critiques to university-level critical analysis.

## Materials

[Research critique examples](stage1_critique_examples.html) (handout or QR code below)

![QR code for critique examples](../images/qr_critique_examples.png){width=50%}

## Step 1: Spotting weak vs strong critiques (10 minutes)

**Show students the QR code or handout**

- Shows research findings with different critiques
- Each example shows a study result followed by limitation statements

**Explain the task:**

Students will see pairs of critiques. Their job is to:

- Decide which critiques are **generic** (could apply to almost any study) vs **specific** (identifies particular features that matter)
- Decide which are **weak** vs **strong**

**In pairs (5 minutes):**

- Look at **Examples 1 and 2 only** (Loftus & Palmer and Milgram)
- For each pair of critiques (A and B): Which is stronger? Why?

**Whole group discussion (5 minutes):**

**Examples 1 & 2** (Loftus & Palmer):

- Which critique did you prefer? Why?
- **Key point:** The weak one says "lacks ecological validity because videos not real accidents" - but the study is about how *question wording* affects memory, not about car accidents specifically. Using videos doesn't undermine that conclusion.
- **Strong version:** Identifies *what* might matter (emotional involvement) and *why* (might interact with suggestibility).

**Examples 3 & 4** (Milgram):

- Weak: "Can't generalise, only American men" - stock phrase, doesn't explain why gender/nationality would matter for obedience
- Strong: Identifies specific context features (scientific authority, lab) and why they might create unique demand characteristics

**Key points to emphasize:**

- **Generic critiques** are swappable - you could say them about any study
- **Specific critiques** identify *which* aspect of the method might limit *which* conclusion
- **Strong critiques** explain *why* the limitation matters

Notice the *language* in strong critiques: "may differ in important ways", "it's unclear whether", "could influence" - acknowledging uncertainty rather than dismissing findings.


## Step 2: Writing your own limitations (10 minutes)

**Materials:** [Study descriptions](stage1_study_scenarios.html) (handout or QR code below)

![QR code for study scenarios](../images/qr_study_scenarios.png){width=50%}

**Introduce the task:**

"Now you'll practice writing limitations as you would in a discussion section. The handout has 6 study descriptions with methodological detail. Choose one to work with."

**Reiterate:** Specific critiques identify *which* aspect of the method might limit *which* conclusion

**In pairs (7 minutes):**

- Each pair chooses **one study** from the handout (or tutor assigns different studies to different pairs)
- Discuss: What would you have written at A-level?
- Focus on: What aspect of the method might limit which conclusion? Why does it matter?
- Write 2-3 sentences identifying specific limitations

**Whole group sharing (3 minutes):**

- 2-3 pairs share their study and limitations (1 minute each)
- Quick feedback: Did they avoid generic critiques? Did they identify specific features? Did they explain why it matters?

**Link to assessment and further practice:**

- When you write discussion sections, generic critiques don't earn marks. The handout has more examples if you want extra practice.
- There's also a [practice worksheet](../tasks/stage1_critique_practice.html) with additional examples and guidance if you want to develop this skill further.

## Example discussion points for each study

Use these if students need prompting during the sharing phase:

**Peterson & Peterson - Short Term Memory**

- Weaker: "Artificial task, lacks ecological validity" (too generic)
- Better: "Consonant trigrams have no semantic meaning; in everyday memory we usually remember meaningful material where we can use elaborative strategies. The effect might not apply to meaningful information."

**Godden & Baddeley - Context Dependent Memory**

- Weaker: "Only used divers, can't generalise" (too generic)
- Better: "Land vs underwater represents an extreme context change; it's unclear whether the effect would be as strong for more subtle context shifts (e.g., different rooms) which are more typical of everyday memory situations."

**Baddeley - Acoustic and Semantic Similarity**

- Weaker: "People don't memorise word lists in real life" (too generic)
- Better: "Unrelated word lists isolate similarity effects but may not reflect how similarity affects memory for connected prose or narratives where context provides additional retrieval cues."

**Ainsworth - Strange Situation**

- Weaker: "Might not generalise to other places" (too generic)
- Better: "Brief lab separations may not reflect longer, real-world separations; behaviors might have different meanings in cultures with different independence values."

**Harlow - Contact Comfort**

- Weaker: "Used monkeys not humans" (too generic)
- Better: "Social isolation likely caused severe stress beyond normal rearing conditions; the preference for cloth might reflect distress response rather than normal attachment processes. Also unclear whether binary choice (wire vs cloth) reflects the multiple factors influencing human infant attachment."

**Baby Einstein**

- Weaker: "Just a correlation" (too generic)
- Better: "Parents self-selected; those buying educational media likely differed in unmeasured ways (e.g. reading/talking more to their children, having more free time and disposable income)."



# Closing

**Ask**

- What's one thing from today you'll remember when writing your practical report discussion?"


**Remind**

- You don't get credit for generic critiques, only strong specific ones
- See the [practice worksheet](../tasks/stage1_critique_practice.html) for additional examples to practice with.
