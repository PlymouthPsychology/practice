This page outlines how staff can support the new self-paced practice task system.

# Practice Task System

The practice tasks are now self-paced and category-based rather than weekly. Students can access all tasks through the [main tasks page](tasks.html).


# Staff Role

Tutors can support this system by:

- **Recommending relevant tasks**: When topics in your lectures or workshops align with practice tasks, mention them to students
- **Encouraging PsyBot use**: Students can get instant AI feedback by uploading completed tasks to [PsyBot](psybot.html)
- **Office hours support**: Use your regular office hours to discuss practice work with students
- **Feedback collection**: Please forward any student comments about the system to Ben Whalley


# Assessment Practice Tasks

The new [Assessment Practice](theme-assessment.html) category contains tasks designed to provide formative feedback on elements of summative assignments. These tasks:

- Target specific skills needed for assessed work
- Provide AI-powered formative feedback
- Help students improve before submitting actual assignments


# Monitoring Progress

You can see which tasks your tutees have completed via PsyBot submissions. 

Login to Psybot (https://psybot.llemma.net/) and request a link to login. 

If you are not recognised by the system, ask Ben Whalley to add you to the staff group.
