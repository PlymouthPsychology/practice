# Overview


What to ***do*** in lectures might seem obvious, but is it really?

Everyone will have their own view about how to make the most of lectures, and what techniques will work best. However, Psychology is about producing *empirical evidence* to support this sort of claim. Ideally, we want to make decisions based on the best available evidence, rather than guesses or hunches.

Let's focus on a specific example:

> How should students *make notes* in lectures?

Specifically, should students use laptops or make handwritten notes?

Please read the extract from [this journal article](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614524581), which describes a study conducted in 2014 with students at Princeton University


Except from: Mueller & Oppenheimer (2014), *The Pen Is Mightier Than the Keyboard: Advantages of Longhand Over Laptop Note Taking*. Psychological Science, 25(6), 1159-1168.

---------------------


> STUDY 1
>
> *Participants* were 67 students (33 male, 33 female, 1 unknown) from the Princeton University subject pool. Two participants were excluded, 1 because he had seen the lecture serving as the stimulus prior to participation, and 1 because of a data-recording error.
>
> Materials: We selected five TED Talks <https://www.ted.com/talks>) for length (slightly over 15 min) and to cover topics that would be interesting but not common knowledge.2 Laptops had full-size (11-in. × 4-in.) keyboards and were disconnected from the Internet.
>
> *Procedure*: Students generally participated 2 at a time, though some completed the study alone. The room was preset with either laptops or notebooks, according to condition. Lectures were projected onto a screen at the front of the room. Participants were instructed to use their normal classroom note-taking strategy, because experimenters were interested in how information was actually recorded in class lectures. The experimenter left the room while the lecture played. Next, participants were taken to a lab; they completed two 5-min distractor tasks and engaged in a taxing working memory task (viz., a reading span task; Unsworth, Heitz, Schrock, & Engle, 2005). At this point, approximately 30 min had elapsed since the end of the lecture. Finally, participants responded to both factual-recall questions (e.g., "Approximately how many years ago did the Indus civilization exist?") and conceptual-application questions (e.g., “How do Japan and Sweden differ in their approaches to equality within their societies?”) about the lecture and completed demographic measures.
>
> The first author scored all responses blind to condition. An independent rater, blind to the purpose of the study and condition, also scored all open-ended questions. Initial interrater reliability was good (α = .89); score disputes between raters were resolved by discussion. Longhand notes were transcribed into text files.



The main results of this study were presented in a graph, shown below (Fig. 1). The y axis shows *z scores*, which are a way of comparing different scores on the same scale. Note that the average score of a z score will always be zero:

# Instructions

::: instruction

1. Summarise the text and the result shown in the figure in your own words. Be concise: no more than 50 words. 

2. Reflect on what the study tells us, and how it might influence what you do in lectures.


##### Summarising

A good strategy for summarising:

First, copy and paste the section above into a new document

Then, summarise the text by: 

- Cutting irrelevant information
- Rephrasing sentences which remain to keep only the *sense* of the original text

Aim for a very concise summary of about 3-4 short sentences (no more than 50 words).


##### Reflect on what we learn

When you have summarised the text, think carefully about what we can learn from this study. 

In particular, you might like to consider these questions:

- Is the study finding clear? 
- Does the data gathered relate to your own circumstances?
- Is this 'good' evidence?
- Has it changed your mind about how you might take notes in lectures?


IMPORTANT: There may not be a simple 'right' answer to these questions. The goal is to think critically about the study and how it might influence your own behaviour.

Example answers:


This one written by me:

Summary: University students watched a TED Talk and were randomly assigned to take notes using either laptops or longhand. After the talk, their knowledge was tested. Performance on factual-recall questions was similar across methods, but laptop users did worse on conceptual-application questions.

Reflection: The study seems like quite good evidence that making notes longhand might be helpful — at least for understanding the content in lectures. A TED talk isn’t the same as a lecture, but it’s similar enough to be an interesting test. It might be that using a laptop is helpful in other ways though — I like to use a computer to keep my notes organised, so it might be less efficient for me to write out notes longhand and then type them up later. And if I didn't spend that extra time then I might lose information and do worse in exams that were many months later.


Other things students might reflect on:

- time period between lecture and test
- complexity of the material
- efficiency in updating notes later
- how they prefer to study, and habits they have developed over time
- ability to use non-linear techniques like mind-mapping on a computer
- how they might use a computer to keep notes organised
- how they might use a computer to search for information during a lecture
- poor handwriting skills and how that might affect note-taking
- variety between lecturers — some include lots of factual materials so might suit laptop method
- physical strain of hand writing (or impact of disability)

Summary:

Mueller and Oppenheimer (2014) conducted a study comparing the effectiveness of handwritten versus laptop note-taking. Participants watched TED Talks and were tested on both factual and conceptual recall. The study found that students who took longhand notes performed better on conceptual questions, suggesting that handwritten notes encourage deeper processing of information.

Reflection:

The study’s findings suggest that handwritten notes may lead to better understanding and retention of complex ideas, as they require more mental effort to process information. This evidence encourages me to reconsider my note-taking strategy. While laptops are convenient, I might switch to handwritten notes for lectures to improve my conceptual learning. However, it’s important to consider that every student learns differently, and this study may not reflect everyone’s experience. Additionally, in fast-paced lectures, laptops might still be more efficient for capturing large amounts of information. Therefore, a mixed approach could be more practical.



Summary:

The study by Mueller and Oppenheimer (2014) looked at how people take notes. It compared laptops and handwriting. They watched videos and answered questions. People who wrote notes by hand did better at answering harder questions. Writing notes on paper might be better.

Reflection:

I think this shows that writing notes is better than typing. I usually use my laptop because it’s faster, but maybe I should write instead. But I’m not sure if it will help me because I can’t write fast enough to keep up in class. So, it might not work for me, but the study says it’s good. I don’t know if it’s right for everyone.
