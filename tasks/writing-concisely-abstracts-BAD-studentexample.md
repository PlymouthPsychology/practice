Loneliness is becoming an increasinly serious problem for young people, and university students in particular. At the same time, the use of social media platforms such as WeChat, Facebook and TikTok has also risen very rapidly and is often described as being problematic or even addictive. Previous research has often shown correlations between these two variables but it is not always clear if loneliness causes social media use or if the opposite is the case.
The aim of this study was to examine whether loneliness and problematic social media use predict each other over time in Chinese college students. 877 students were recruited from four universities, with a final sample of 538 analysed after dropout, which was not considered to have a major effect on the results. Participants completed questionairs on loneliness and social media use, along with other demographic details, at three time points across one year.
The data were analized using cross-lagged models and latent growth models in SPSS 26 and MPlus 8.3. Results showed loneliness significantly predicted problematic social media use at later timepoints, and problematic social media use also predicted loneliness. Both variables also increased gradually over the year of study. The results showed significant intercepts and slopes for both loneliness and problematic social media use, which were found to be correlated together.
These findings suggest that loneliness and problematic social media use have a bi-directional relation, meaning that each one increases the other. This has important implication for university students in China and maybe other countrys too. Educators and policymakers should perhaps consider making interventions to reduce loneliness and also to encourage more healthy social media habbits in students.
