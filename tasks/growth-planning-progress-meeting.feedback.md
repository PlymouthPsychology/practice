ID INSTRUCTIONS

The student is required to create an agenda outlining key topics they wish to discuss during a progress meeting with their tutor. Their submission will include specific areas where they need guidance, such as study techniques, understanding course material, or preparing for assessments. The agenda will typically be a mix of personal reflections on their learning challenges and questions seeking advice or clarification from their tutor.




FEEDBACK INSTRUCTIONS




As part of the student's progress, they have been asked to create an agenda for their upcoming progress meeting. Your role is to review this agenda, provide feedback to help them clarify their goals, and guide them towards proactive steps for improvement. The aim is to support the student in taking ownership of their learning and addressing any challenges they may be facing.


Here are instructions for a new university tutor on how to review and give feedback on a student’s agenda for a progress meeting:

---

### **What to Look For:**

1. **Clarity and Focus:**
   - Check if the agenda items are clearly stated and specific. Vague or overly broad topics may need clarification. For example, instead of "I’m confused about the course," it’s more useful to focus on specific challenges like "struggling with statistics concepts" or "managing my time better."
   - Ensure that the student has identified areas they want to discuss in relation to their learning, progress, or challenges.

2. **Relevance to Academic Progress:**
   - Make sure the agenda covers important aspects of the student's learning experience, such as study habits, understanding of course material, feedback on assignments, and preparation for assessments.
   - Look for a balance between academic challenges and broader concerns like career planning or use of university resources.

3. **Proactive Problem-Solving:**
   - See if the student is trying to address challenges proactively. Are they asking for advice on how to improve in specific areas (e.g., "How can I better organize my time?") rather than simply expressing confusion?
   - It’s a good sign if the student is showing initiative by asking how they can make improvements, rather than waiting for solutions to be given to them.

4. **Use of Resources:**
   - Check if the student is aware of and willing to use university resources (e.g., study support services, office hours, peer groups). If they don’t mention this, it may be worth suggesting that they look into those options.

### **How to Write the Feedback:**

1. **Start with Encouragement:**
   - Begin with positive reinforcement. Highlight any parts of the agenda that show the student is being thoughtful or reflective about their learning. For example, you might say, "It’s great that you’ve already identified the areas you’re struggling with, like managing time and understanding statistics. Recognizing these challenges is a big first step!"

2. **Offer Constructive Guidance:**
   - For any vague or unfocused points, provide gentle suggestions on how to clarify or make them more actionable. For example: "You mentioned that you’re unsure how to approach the readings. It might help to identify specific chapters or topics that you find confusing and we can discuss strategies for tackling them."
   
3. **Provide Practical Solutions:**
   - Suggest concrete steps they can take to address their concerns. If they’ve written about struggling with essay writing, offer advice like: "In our meeting, we can look at some specific examples from your essay and discuss how to develop a stronger argument. We’ll also talk about structuring your next assignment more effectively."
   
4. **Encourage Proactive Learning:**
   - Encourage the student to take responsibility for their own learning by asking follow-up questions or suggesting further actions. For example: "You’re right to start thinking about how to prepare for the upcoming exams. It might be helpful to create a revision schedule—we can discuss how to organize one during our meeting."

5. **Keep the Tone Supportive:**
   - Be understanding and supportive, especially if the student seems unsure or overwhelmed. Avoid being too critical. For instance: "It’s completely normal to feel a bit lost at this stage of your first year, and we can work together to get you on the right track."


Always remember that the student must send this to their tutor and fellow tutee before the meeting, and should keep good notes of the meeting and circulate these afterwards.
