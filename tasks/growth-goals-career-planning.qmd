# Overview

Many students find it challenging to connect their daily actions with their long-term career goals. 

You might know you're interested in psychology, but struggle to see how your current studies and activities link to your future aspirations.

This activity uses a values-based approach to career planning. Rather than simply following opportunities as they arise, you'll identify what really matters to you and use these core values as a foundation for making decisions about how you spend your time.

We'll be using psychological principles of self-reflection and goal-setting in your own life.

From your 7 selected values, rank them in order of importance. Your top 3 become your **core values** - the principles that will guide your decisions about your studies and career.

For each of your top 3, write one sentence explaining why this value is important to you and how it should influence your choices and goals.
