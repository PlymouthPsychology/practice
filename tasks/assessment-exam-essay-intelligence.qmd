## Why practicing exam essays matters

Writing practice essays is one of the most effective ways to prepare for exams. 

When you practice answering exam questions, you develop your ability to recall relevant information, structure arguments clearly, and manage your time effectively. Practice also helps you identify gaps in your understanding whilst there's still time to address them.

Regular practice builds confidence and reduces exam anxiety. Each attempt helps you refine your writing style, strengthen your critical thinking, and learn how to express complex ideas concisely under time pressure. Students who practice exam questions consistently tend to perform better in the actual exam because they've already worked through the challenges of constructing coherent arguments and marshalling evidence effectively.


## Formative feedback from PsyBot

We can offer formative feedback on your practice essays through PsyBot. The feedback is tailored to the essay topics as they were taught on your course, and PsyBot knows what we expect from stronger or weaker student answers. This means the feedback should be relevant and targeted towards improvements that would help you achieve a better grade in the exam.


## About this practice task

As part of a trial this year, we have trained PsyBot to give feedback on three practice essay topics:

- Intelligence
- tbc
- tbc


Psybot has been given information about each of these topics, and what we expect from student answers. It will then give feedback on your essay, highlighting areas where you need to improve, and suggesting ways to strengthen your argument.



## 3 questions to practice

### **"Compare and contrast the Raven's Matrices and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. Which is the better measure in your view and why?"**

To answer this question you need to:

- review Alison's lecture, and identify the key points
- read sections of the textbook chapter to get extended background information

### QUESTION 3

## Essay writing tips

**Plan** -- Spend 5 minutes planning before you start writing. Jot down the key concepts (e.g. for the intelligence essay: *g*, fluid intelligence, crystallised intelligence) and the main strengths and limitations of each test. This helps you structure your argument coherently.

**Answer the question directly** -- The intelligence question asks you to compare, contrast, and evaluate. Make sure you do all three. Don't just describe each test separately -- explicitly compare them and state which you think is better with clear reasoning.

**Define key terms early** -- Start by briefly explaining what general intelligence (g) is, and Cattell's distinction between fluid and crystallised intelligence. This shows you understand the theoretical framework and helps you build your argument.

**Use evidence to support claims** -- When you make a point (e.g., "WAIS has higher predictive validity"), support it with evidence from lectures or the textbook. Even in exam conditions, showing you can recall and apply key studies or statistics strengthens your answer.

**Be critical, not just descriptive** -- Don't just list features of each test. Evaluate them: Which is more reliable? Which is fairer across cultures? Which is more practical? Show you can think critically about the strengths and limitations of each measure.

**Write concisely** -- In a one-hour exam, you have limited time. Write clearly and get to the point. Avoid padding your answer with unnecessary detail. Strong essays are focused and well-structured, not just long.

**Conclude with a clear position** -- End by stating which test you think is better and why, or explain why it depends on context (e.g., clinical diagnosis vs cross-cultural research). A clear conclusion shows confident, evaluative thinking.

## This is a trial system

We are trialing PsyBot to see how useful students find the feedback. The system is not perfect, and PsyBot can make mistakes. You need to think carefully for yourself when you interpret the feedback. If you're unsure about anything, please contact your tutor and ask for clarification, perhaps in office hours.
