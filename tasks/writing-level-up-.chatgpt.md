Students were asked to identify problems with and re-write the following sentences. The aim was to spot the problem and make it clearer and more readable, in UK English.


### Example of the student task

First they saw this example:


1.	The researchers found evidence of life on Mars, they also found pigs on Jupiter. 
Problem: Need to use a full stop to separate two different ideas.
Re-written: The researchers found evidence of life on Mars. They also found pigs on Jupiter.


### Students had to correct a further series of sentences

These sentences were deliberately crafted to include common mistakes they could correct as practice.




# YOUR TASK NOW: CHECK STUDENT WORK AND GIVE FEEDBACK

I am the academic who set the assignment. 
I want you to read the students work (included below) carefully and check if it matches my suggestions.

Below are the sentences students had to fix, and some guidance on what they should have done. I also provide and example of how it could be re-written.


2.	Each child was seated at a table on which there was a display of ten faces.
Problem to fix: Rewrite concisely using the active voice (someone did something, rather than something was done to someone).
Better version: Each child viewed (a display of) ten faces. (‘a display of’ might be useful to convey that the 10 faces were shown at the same time)


3.	The results for both experiments showed that hedgehogs scored 77% and wombats scored 62%.
Problem to fix: The phrase ‘The results showed that’ is  unnecessary – simply state the results.
Better version: In both experiments, hedgehogs scored 77% and wombats scored 62%.

4.	Seventy marmosets partook in the study. 
Problem to fix: Partook is a weird term to use and not correct.
Better version:  Seventy marmosets maybe partook in a dainty tea with cucumber sandwiches, but seventy marmosets took part in the study.

5.	The participants were half male and half female. 
Problem to fix:  Ambiguity: 
Better version: Half the participants were male and half were female.

6.	There was no affect of rain on mood. However, mood was effected by videos of kittens.
Problem to fix: Affect and effect were the wrong way around. 
Better version: There was no effect of rain on mood. However, mood was affected by videos of kittens.

Special note: These words (affect/effect) are used a lot in psychology, so it is important for students to get them right. 
    - Affect is usually a verb, meaning to alter or make a difference
    - Effect is usually a noun meaning "a result". 
    - 'effect' can also be a verb meaning "to bring about" or "to cause".
    - 'affect' can also be a noun meaning mood or emotion, for example ‘Low affect is a symptom of depression’.
    Pay attention: if students mix up these usages try to offer help.


7.	The results of this experiment showed that children in the sweets and caffeine condition performed better than children in the lettuce and broccoli condition. 
Problem to fix: Student shoulds just state the results and avoid extra words.
Better version: Children in the sweets and caffeine condition performed better than children in the lettuce and broccoli condition.

8.	A total of 71 people were used in this study. 
Problem to fix: Researchers don’t ‘use’ people in experiements. We always respect our participants when we are writing about them.
Better version: A total of 71 people took part in this study. 

9.	Questionnaires were completed by four participants. 
Problem to fix: Use the active voice
Better version: Four human participants completed questionnaires.

# YOUR FEEDBACK TO STUDENTS

Think about this step by step. 
Look through each of the students' sentences. Did they improve the wording? Does their change match my suggestions? 

If the student skipped some sentences just note this (make suggestions anyway).

Give succinct feedback on the sentences the student amended. 
Praise where they have made the sentence clearer. Make suggestions when their version, or the problem they identified, did not match the suggestions above.



# FORMATTING THE FEEDBACK

For each sentence, use this format to respond:


***Life on Mars***: You correctly identified the problem and added a full stop to split this sentence. Good job. 

or 

***Life on Mars***: The issue here was that the sentence includes two different ideas and is ambiguous. It could be improved by splitting the sentence in two, for example: *The researchers found evidence of life on Mars. They also found pigs on Jupiter.*


The format is:

***<sentence label>***:  <Feedback on the student's work>. <optional reworded suggestion>.


Use paragraph breaks to separate the examples. 

At the start and end give a short summary of how they did. 

Write as though you are giving the feedback to the student face to face.
