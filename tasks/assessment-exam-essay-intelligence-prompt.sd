**Compare and contrast the Raven’s Matrices and Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale. Which is the better measure in your view and why?**

## Summary of a strong essay

Strong essays should clearly explain general intelligence (g) and Cattell’s distinction between fluid (Gf) and crystallised (Gc) intelligence), then use these ideas to compare the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) and Raven’s Progressive Matrices (RM). The WAIS measures both Gf and Gc through 12 subtests, producing Verbal, Performance, and Full-Scale IQ scores; it is comprehensive, statistically reliable, and highly predictive of academic and occupational outcomes, but culturally biased, time-consuming, and dependent on education and language. Raven’s Matrices measure only Gf via abstract, non-verbal pattern reasoning, offering a quicker and more "culture-fair" test used in heritability and cross-cultural research, but with narrower scope and weaker predictive validity. Good essays justify which is "better" — perhaps arguing WAIS for diagnostic breadth and predictive power, RM for fairness and focus on innate reasoning — or might argue that suitability depends on context.
Markers should look for clear conceptual grounding in g, Gf, and Gc; accurate description of each test; and critical evaluation supported by evidence (e.g., adoption/SES studies showing Gc’s environmental influence, twin studies linking Gf to heritability, high WAIS–WASI correlations, cultural bias data, and age effects on Gf vs Gc). Strong essays integrate such evidence to explain why one test is preferable or more appropriate for a given purpose, not just state it.
Higher-quality answers connect theory to application, discuss cultural and social implications (fairness, labelling, equity), and show awareness that intelligence testing is both scientifically useful and socially constructed. Essays may differ in conclusion, but reward should go to coherent argumentation, conceptual precision, and critical engagement rather than rote description.
Essays were written under exam conditions, so memorisation of citations or specific studies is less important than good explanations of key ideas and linking these to an clear answer to the question.

# Specific guidance for the essay:



## 1. Overview -- What the Essay Should Have Been About

The Q asks students to **compare and contrast two key measures of intelligence** -- Raven’s Progressive Matrices and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS).  

A good essay will:

- Explain the **concept of general intelligence (g)** and **Cattell’s distinction between fluid (Gf) and crystallised (Gc) intelligence)**.
- Describe each test, the aspects of intelligence it measures, and its strengths and weaknesses.
- Compare them on **psychometric**, **practical**, and **cultural** grounds.
- Make an **evaluative argument** about which is the "better" test -- justified with reasoning and evidence, not assertion.
- Recognise that intelligence testing is socially and culturally situated (e.g. bias, fairness, and labelling).

There is **no single correct conclusion** -- good essays may defend either WAIS or Raven’s as the better test -- but they must do so coherently, with evidence and conceptual understanding.


## 2. Core Concepts Students Should Cover

### **General Intelligence (g)**
- Introduced by **Spearman (1904)** -- the idea that performance across diverse cognitive tasks reflects a single underlying factor.
- Tests like WAIS and Raven’s aim to estimate *g* through specific indicators.

### **Fluid and Crystallised Intelligence (Cattell, 1963)**
- **Fluid intelligence (Gf):** Innate reasoning ability, problem-solving, pattern recognition, working memory. Declines with age.  
- **Crystallised intelligence (Gc):** Acquired knowledge and skills from culture and education. Increases with experience.
- Gf underpins Gc: people with high Gf learn and apply Gc more effectively.
- **Relevance:** WAIS measures both Gf and Gc; Raven’s focuses only on Gf.

## 3. The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)

### **Structure**
- 12 subtests assessing verbal and non-verbal abilities.
- Yields three scores:
  - **Verbal IQ (Gc)**
  - **Performance IQ (Gf)**
  - **Full-Scale IQ (FSIQ)** -- composite measure approximating *g*.
- Normed so **mean IQ = 100**, **SD = 15** (normal distribution).

### **Examples of Subtests**
- **Gc:** Vocabulary, Information, Similarities (acquired knowledge).  
- **Gf:** Matrix Reasoning, Block Design, Picture Completion (abstract reasoning).  

### **Psychometric Qualities**
- **Reliability:** Test–retest correlations typically high (> 0.9).  
- **Validity:** Predictive of academic and occupational outcomes.
- **Convergent validity:** WAIS correlates with other standard IQ measures (e.g. Stanford–Binet).

### **Applications**
- Clinical and educational settings (e.g. assessing dyslexia, brain injury, developmental disorders).
- Is the basis for short forms such as **WASI**, which correlates > .9 with full WAIS, providing faster screening (~30 min).

### **Strengths**
- WAIS is a broad assessment of *both* Gf and Gc -- good approximation of *g*.
- High reliability and strong predictive validity.
- Extensively normed and researched; data can be compared to previous studies.

### **Limitations**
- **Cultural bias:** Relies heavily on language and culturally specific knowledge.
- **Environmental influence:** SES and educational access strongly affect Gc scores.
  - *Example:* Adoption studies -- 14-year-olds with both biological and adoptive parents in high-SES homes had mean IQ ≈ 119, while those from low-SES homes averaged ≈ 91.
- **Time and training:** Requires 60–90 minutes and a trained examiner.  
  - The WAIS is **individually administered**, not a self-report or group test.  
  - Each of the 12 subtests (e.g. Vocabulary, Block Design, Matrix Reasoning) must be **presented, timed, and scored** according to strict procedures in a manual.  
  - Some scoring requires examiner judgement (e.g. partial credit for near-correct answers), and discontinuation rules vary by subtest.  
  - Therefore, only **qualified psychologists** can administer and interpret it to maintain reliability and standardisation.  
  - The full assessment typically takes **60–90 minutes**, sometimes longer in clinical settings, making it **labour-intensive but precise** compared with quicker, culture-fair tests like Raven’s.

### **Arguments in Favour**
- Offers a *comprehensive profile* of intelligence, not just reasoning ability.
- Better suited for diagnosis, research, and individual comparison.
- Predictive and reliable -- hence the "gold standard."


## 4. Raven’s Progressive Matrices (RM)

### **Structure**

- Non-verbal test of pattern completion: participants select the missing piece in a visual matrix of shapes and patterns.
- Progressively harder items; measures **abstract reasoning** and **pattern recognition**.
- Designed to tap **Gf** (fluid intelligence) independently of language and schooling.

### **Psychometric Qualities**

- **Reliability:** Test–retest is still high ≈ .8–.9, but slightly lower than WAIS.
- **Construct validity:** Correlates with other measures of Gf (≈ .7–.8).
- **Predictive validity:** More limited than WAIS for real-world success.

### **Applications**

- Widely used in **twin and heritability studies**, because it isolates Gf.  
  - *Example:* MZ twin studies report heritability estimates for Gf ≈ 0.6–0.8.
- Common in **cross-cultural comparisons** and settings with limited literacy.

### **Strengths**
- **Culture-fair:** Minimal language, less affected by education and SES.
- **Practical:** Quick, inexpensive, suitable for large-scale or group testing.
- **Focuses on reasoning ability:** Purportedly a purer measure of inherited intelligence.

### **Limitations**
- **Narrow scope:** Assesses only Gf -- ignores acquired knowledge (Gc).
- **Limited diagnostic value:** Poor indicator of applied skills or verbal comprehension.
- **Cultural fairness overstated:** Performance still affected by exposure to abstract tests or problem-solving styles.  
  - *Example:* Korean–US MZ twins reared apart -- identical genetics, but IQ scores diverged (US twin lower on both WAIS and Raven’s). Highlights environmental influence even on "culture-fair" tests.

### **Arguments in Favour**
- Fairer for cross-cultural use; less biased by education or language.
- Better suited for genetic or cross-national research.
- Captures the biologically grounded, reasoning component of intelligence.



## 5. Comparison Summary

| Aspect | **WAIS** | **Raven’s Matrices** |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Type of intelligence** | Measures both Gf and Gc | Measures only Gf |
| **Construct coverage** | Broad (12 subtests, verbal + performance) | Narrow (abstract reasoning) |
| **Cultural bias** | High (language-dependent) | Low (non-verbal) |
| **Predictive validity** | Strong (academic, occupational) | Weaker |
| **Reliability** | Very high  | Good  |
| **Use cases** | Clinical, diagnostic, educational | Research, cross-cultural, genetic |
| **Practicality** | Time-consuming, needs training | Quick, simple, group testing |
| **Fairness** | SES/education bias | Less bias, but not bias-free |


## 6. Argumentation Strategies Students Might Use

Good essays may take **different defensible positions**. Markers should reward coherent reasoning, accurate conceptualisation, and use of evidence, not the particular conclusion.

### **Argument 1: WAIS is better**
- Measures *both* Gf and Gc → fuller picture of cognitive ability.
- Strong psychometric evidence and predictive validity.
- Widely used and standardised → benchmark for diagnosis and research.
- Raven’s too narrow -- neglects learned intelligence and practical application.

*Example reasoning:*  
> "Although Raven’s Matrices minimise cultural bias, they only measure pattern-based reasoning. WAIS, by assessing both reasoning and acquired knowledge, better predicts real-world performance and educational attainment."


### **Argument 2: Raven’s is better**
- Minimises cultural, linguistic, and SES bias → fairer across populations.
- Focuses on Gf, thought to be biologically inherited and less environmentally confounded.
- Simpler and quicker → suitable for large-scale testing and heritability research.
- WAIS unfairly disadvantages those from non-Western or less educated backgrounds.

*Example reasoning:*  
> "Raven’s provides a more equitable measure of innate reasoning ability, avoiding the educational and linguistic bias inherent in the WAIS’s verbal subtests."


### **Argument 3: Context-dependent view**
- The "better" test depends on purpose:  
  - For *diagnostic or educational use*: WAIS.  
  - For *cross-cultural comparison or Gf research*: Raven’s.  
- Both valid for their respective domains.

*Example reasoning:*  

> "While WAIS is indispensable for clinical and educational assessment due to its breadth, Raven’s remains preferable for cross-cultural or heritability research where environmental confounds must be minimised."


## 7. Theoretical and Broader Context

- **Alternative models:** Brief mention of Gardner’s *multiple intelligences* or Sternberg’s *triarchic theory* acceptable, but should not dominate -- limited empirical support for these has limited adoption in research and clinical settings.
- **Social implications:** Essays can note that IQ testing affects social labelling (giftedness, disability) and has cultural and political implications.  
  - **Labelling effects:** IQ scores are often used to classify individuals as "gifted," "average," or as having "learning difficulties." While this can help secure support or access to special education, it may also **reinforce stigma, self-fulfilling prophecies, or social stratification**.  
  - **Educational consequences:** School placement, streaming, and access to resources are sometimes based on IQ results, which can **amplify existing inequalities** if the tests reflect cultural or socioeconomic bias.  
  - **Cultural politics:** Historically, IQ testing has been misused to justify racial or class hierarchies (e.g. eugenic arguments, biased cross-cultural comparisons). Modern test developers work to avoid this, but **cultural loading in tests like WAIS remains** an ethical concern.  
  - **Employment and policy use:** Some employers and military organisations have used IQ-type tests for selection, raising debates about fairness and whether they genuinely measure job-relevant ability.  
  - **Social construction of intelligence:** Essays may reflect critically on whether "intelligence" is an objective, measurable trait or a **socially defined construct** that reflects cultural values (e.g. what counts as ‘smart’ in Western vs. non-Western contexts).  
  - **Balance for credit:** Students who acknowledge both sides—usefulness for diagnosis and prediction *and* potential for inequity or misuse—demonstrate higher-level evaluation.
- **Construct validity:** Some may critique whether intelligence is a "real" psychological trait or a **social construction** that reflects what a culture values as "intelligent."  
  - Good essays might question whether tests like the WAIS or Raven’s truly measure an underlying mental capacity (*g*) or whether they simply **operationalise performance on culturally shaped tasks** (e.g. problem-solving valued in Western education).  
  - Others may argue that the high intercorrelations between different cognitive tasks support the existence of a genuine latent factor (*g*), giving these tests **strong construct validity**.  
  - Either view is acceptable if linked back to how each test assumes that intelligence is a measurable, quantifiable construct rather than a context-dependent set of skills.


## 8. Marking Guidance and Feedback Tips

### **Excellent essays should:**
- Clearly explain *g*, *Gf*, *Gc*.
- Accurately describe both tests and relate them to these constructs.
- Compare tests systematically (scope, fairness, validity, practicality).
- Support claims with some evidence (e.g., SES studies, twin studies, reliability data). However note that this question was only covered in a single 2 hour lecture, so students did not have lots of content/evidence/background to work with.
- Conclude with a justified position about which test is "better" or contextually superior.
- Use examples or applications (clinical, educational, cross-cultural).

### **Good essays:**
- Mention both tests and Gf/Gc but with limited depth.
- Some descriptive imbalance (e.g. much on WAIS, little on Raven’s).
- Weak evidence or generic statements ("Raven’s is fairer" without explanation).
- May confuse Gf and Gc.

### **Weaker, but still acceptable essays:**
- Fail to clearly distinguish Gf and Gc.
- Are mostly descriptive with little comparison or argument.
- Confuse or omit details (e.g. call Raven’s "Gc test").
- No evidence or conceptual grounding.

### Essays that 'Require improvement'

- Entirely descriptive or not argued
- Little/no evidence support for points
- Poorly written
- Demonstrate lack of engagement

### **Feedback emphasis:**
- Encourage stronger linkage between theory (Gf/Gc, g) and test description.  
- Ask for *why* one is better if this wasn't clear.  
- Urge more use of empirical evidence (SES, twin, heritability, predictive validity); athough bear in mind students didn't cover much evidence in class, so expectation should be lower here.  
- Highlight clarity and structure: define key terms early; separate description from evaluation.

## 9. Example Evidence Students Might Cite

These points should be praised but are not necessarily _required_

- **Adoption / SES studies:** Higher IQ in children from high-SES adoptive homes (≈ +15–20 IQ points).  
- **Twin studies:** MZ twins reared apart show high correlation on Raven’s → heritability of Gf ≈ 0.8.  
- **WASI correlation:** r ≈ .9 with WAIS → supports reliability and construct validity.  
- **Cultural bias:** Non-Western groups underperform on WAIS verbal subtests due to language/education differences.  
- **Age effects:** Gf declines with age, Gc increases -- consistent with WAIS subtest patterns.


## 10. Checklist for Markers

1. Demonstrates understanding of *g*, *Gf*, and *Gc*.
2. Accurately describes both WAIS and Raven’s, including subtests and purpose.
3. Evaluates the tests in relation to one or more of fairness, reliability, validity, and practical use.
4. Supports arguments with empirical evidence (this may be lightweight, but some should be present).
5. Presents a reasoned conclusion about which is "better," depending on context.


**Acceptable diversity of answers:**  
- "WAIS is better" -- justified by reliability, predictive validity, comprehensiveness.  
- "Raven’s is better" -- justified by fairness, focus on Gf, cross-cultural applicability.  
- "It depends on purpose" -- justified balance with awareness of trade-offs.  

**Markers should reward/praise:**  
- Conceptual understanding  
- Coherent argumentation  
- Use of evidence 
- Critical engagement (not rote description)

# TASK: Provide formative feedback to the student

Philosopher Stephen Toulmin developed a method for analyzing and structuring arguments. The model comprises six elements:

- Claim: The main point or position being argued for.
- Grounds: The evidence or reasons supporting the claim.
- Warrant: The logical connection between the grounds and the claim.
- Backing: Additional support for the warrant, providing further assurance that the warrant is valid.
- Qualifier: A statement that indicates the strength of the leap from the grounds to the claim, often using terms like "most likely" or "usually".
- Rebuttal: Counter-arguments or statements indicating circumstances in which the claim would not hold true.

We want to evaluate the student's essay in terms of the quality of their arguments.

# TASK NOW: Provide formative feedback to the student

Students often make similar errors/mistakes or have similar weaknesses in their answers.

This guide summarises **typical mistakes** students make when answering the question:  
**"Compare and contrast the Raven’s Matrices and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS). Which is the better measure in your view and why?"**

1. Conceptual Errors

**Confusion between Gf, Gc, and g**
- Reversing definitions of fluid (Gf) and crystallised (Gc) intelligence.  
  *e.g.* "Gf is learned knowledge; Gc is innate."  
- Treating *g* as identical to IQ, or as separate from Gf/Gc.  
- Missing that Cattell’s theory subdivides *g* into Gf and Gc.

**Feedback tip:** Reward correct linkage between Gf/Gc and test content. Mark down if confusion undermines logic.

**Poor grasp of psychometric concepts**
- Confusing reliability and validity.  
- Misusing terms: "generalisable" for "standardised," "accurate" for "valid."  
- Reporting correlations (e.g. *r* = .9) without interpretation.  
- Claiming WAIS is "more scientific" without explanation.



2. Argument and Structure Problems

**Description without Comparison**
- Listing features of each test separately with no explicit contrast.  
  *e.g.* "WAIS has 12 subtests… Raven’s uses patterns."  
- No linking phrases like *"Unlike WAIS, Raven’s…"*

**Feedback:** "Show explicit similarities and differences rather than two isolated summaries."

**Unclear evaluation**
- Stating "WAIS is better" without criteria (validity, fairness, etc.).  
- Treating "better" as moral or procedural ("fairer," "easier"), not psychometric.

**Feedback:** Encourage students to **define what ‘better’ means** and evaluate consistently.

**Over-generalisation**
- Using one case (e.g. twins) as universal proof.  
- Claiming "Raven’s completely removes cultural bias."  
- "WAIS is the only valid test."  

**Feedback:** Reward nuance: "depends on purpose," "reduces but doesn’t eliminate bias."

**Lack of integration between theory and evidence**
- Defining Gf/Gc but not linking to test items.  
- Citing studies (SES, twins) without explaining what they show.  
- Adding Gardner/Sternberg as "padding" rather than analysis.

**Feedback:** Push for explicit **theory → test → evidence → judgement** structure.


**Weak essay structure or focus**
- Long introductions about "what intelligence is" before answering.  
- Poor paragraphing; no clear conclusion or argument line.  
- Repetition, unclear stance ("both have pros and cons").  

**Feedback:** Encourage signposting ("This essay compares…"), concise structure, and a definite conclusion.


3. Misinterpretation or Misuse of Evidence

**SES and Adoption Studies**
- Misattributing SES effects to genetics.  
- Missing that SES mainly influences **Gc**, not Gf.  
  *Correct reference:* Scarr & Weinberg (1976); Capron & Duyme (1989).

**Twin Studies**
- Correctly relevant to **Gf heritability** (Bouchard et al., 1990), but students often fail to name or interpret.  
  *Feedback:* Ask them to explain that high MZ correlations on Raven’s support genetic influence on Gf.


**Cultural Bias**
- Overstating culture-fairness of Raven’s.  
- Failing to note WAIS attempts to include non-verbal subtests.  


4. Language, Tone, and Clarity

**Overuse of technical jargon**
- "Ecological validity," "audit trails," "variables controllable" — if misapplied.  
**Feedback:** Encourage precision; reward clarity over complexity.


5. Thematic / Philosophical Overreach

**Irrelevant digressions**
- Long passages on "what intelligence really is," "social inequality," or "capitalism and IQ" without tying to the tests.

**Feedback:** Accept brief discussion of construct validity or social implications if linked back to WAIS/Raven’s evaluation.

**Uncritical moralising**
- "IQ tests are oppressive and meaningless."  
**Feedback:** Give partial credit for critical awareness but redirect toward evidence-based evaluation.

6. Missing or Weak Conclusion
- Ending with "both have pros and cons."  
- No answer to *"Which is better and why?"*  
**Feedback:** Remind students to **state a position** — even if conditional ("depends on context").  

Now read the student essay carefully:

<essay>

</essay>

Does the student commit any of the errors/mistakes or have any weaknesses in their answer?  Be specific and make notes for each (don't quote from the essay).

[[think:commmon_errors]]

Now, extract quotes from the essay which show/exemplify the errors/mistakes or have weaknesses in their answer.  State NONE if there are no examples.

> [[extract:common_errors_examples]]

Now summarise these points into thoughts/notes for yourself when you meet the student next:

[[think:common_errors_summary]]

Now, comment on the student's effort and engagement

Students took a 6-lecture course on personality and intelligence testing. The material for this essay was delivered in a single, 2-hour lecture. Students were expected to read additional material and spend around 8 hours on the topic.

In the exam students had 1 hour to complete the essay. 
Good students write about 1.5 to 2 pages in this time, between 5 and 9 paragraphs including introduction, body, and conclusion.
Good students refer to a range of materials and sources from the teaching.

Reflect on:

- how much has the student written? (length is not everything but very short answers indicate low effort)
- did they use the exam time effectively?
- did they engage with the material and question?
- did they 'pad out' their answer with irrelevant details?
- could they have used their time more effectively?

We must provide feedback for the student.

This will be feedback the student reads: it must be written specifically for them, in a style and register that they can understand.

Organise your feedback as follows:

Para 1:
- saying something positive first, then 
- if there are any mistakes -- factual or conceptual errors -- make sure this is stated clearly. 
- identify areas for improvement (if any; for good/excellent essays don't create makework)

Para 2:
- Focus on details. 
- Give one concrete sugggestion for improvement ("for example, you might ...") for improvement, without actually re-writing the students' essay for them. 
- If the essay is excellent, praise something they did well and give an example.

Para 3:
- If any, refer to other areas that would benefit from additional work or comment on the overall quality of the essay.
- Finally, provide an encouraging remark, if possible, emphasising something positive from the feedback or something they can work on to improve their grade.

The balance/tone of your feedback should reflect the overall quality of the work. 
- Excellent essays should have feedback that is mostly praise/noting good things included.
- Where the essay is poor or has substantial weaknesses, the feedback should make this clear. 
- Be kind, but don't sugar coat.

- Feedback can be up to 3 paragraphs in length.
- Write feedback directly for the student ("Your essay ..." etc.)
- Avoid suggestions for new content, outside that suggested in the feedback so far.
