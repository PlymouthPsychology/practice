# Overview


While some stage 1 students may have left school some time ago, it is important---both in your development as a Psychologist and Citizen---that you can reflect on how different these two institutions are. 

There are many differences between school and universty, but one I would like to focus on is that in their training, teachers spend a great deal of time learning about **behavioural management**. This is not the case for the academics who will lead your workshops and lectures at Plymouth. [Although, we still expect people to be courteous and respectful in teaching sessions].


Please read this document which give a brief outline of what behavioural management involves. https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/initial-teacher-training-itt-core-content-framework/the-trainee-teacher-behavioural-toolkit-a-summary
