XXX TODO ADD A VIDEO EXPLAINER OF ALL THIS MATERIAL AT THE HEAD OF THE PAGE

# Overview

Albert Einstein is quoted as saying "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough", and it's true that explaining a concept to someone else is a great way to consolidate your understanding of it.

In this task, we practice explaining a concept from a lecture to a friend, as if you were leaving them a voice note.

# Instructions

::: instruction
1.  Choose ONE of the slides from below (both are from lectures which happen this week)
2.  Go to the lecture and listen carefully
3.  *Without* any of the other slides in front of you, imagine explaining it to a friend in a WhatsApp-style voice-note (see how to record below).

# Slides to explain

(The full lecture is [here](xxx.html) if you want to listen to it again.)

Slide 2:

# Recording your work

::: instruction
Record your "voice note" using

-   the "Voice Memos" app on iPhone, or
-   the "Voice Recorder" app on Android

Don't use WhatsApp because it's harder to upload later.

When you add your practice upload an audio file of your voice note. Psybot will listen to the audio and give you feedback.

# Extension activities

-   Try practicing the task more than once.

-   You could also try explaining the same concept to different friends or family members. Does it make a difference if you explain it to someone who knows the topic in general (e.g. another student), vs. someone who has never studied psychology?
