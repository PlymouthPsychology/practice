title: "Think like a mean marker"
subtitle: "Remove distractions from your writing."
author: Jackie Andrade
description: "This task helps you think more about the person who is reading your work. You will practice thinking like a very cynical marker and discover how unnecessary phrases or poorly worded sentences can distract from the point the writer is making."

We love clear, concise writing, like you practiced in the first Writing exercise. In this exercise, we want you to get inside the head of the meanest marker you can imagine. This marker has already marked a big stack of coursework. They are tired and grumpy. They have just picked up an essay that contains some of their pet hates. We’d like you to have some fun expressing their frustration. We would like you to act as a super-critical marker – Professor Perfect - and insert your thoughts about the writing. Professor Snippy has provided an example.

This is the writing that Prof Snippy is marking:

> Since the time of evolution a plethora of research has shown that cows like grass. The first person to research the food preferences of cows was Bloggs (2014), who found that they chose grass more often than baked beans. It is therefore clear that cows like grass.

Prof Snippy is marking a student essay and  has inserted their thoughts while reading it in square brackets:

> Since the time of evolution \[*What, has evolution stopped??*\] a plethora of research \[*How much is a plethora? Does the quantity matter???*\] has shown that cows like grass. The first person \[*I think I read an earlier study... Maybe this was the first one the student has heard of. Should I check??*\] to research the food preferences of cows was Bloggs (2014), who found that they chose grass more often than baked beans. It is therefore clear \[*It’s not clear to me... choosing grass doesn’t mean cows like it. Maybe they just don’t like baked beans?*\] that cows like grass.

Notice how Prof Snippy’s comments are not just about the writing, but also about the content. The writing is not clear, and so the content is also unclear.
By clearing up the writing Prof. Snippy is more likely to understand the content
and give us the benefit of the doubt.

In this activity, you will practice thinking like a mean marker.


# Instructions

This is the writing that Professor Perfect (that’s you!) is marking next. 

```
An amazingly vast array of research (__________) has found affects (__________) of smoking on health (Pickle, 1990) (__________). One study found that as many as 50% of all smokers die (__________). Another study tested if quitting smoking reduced death rates but unfortunately its results were insignificant (__________). Some research has looked into genetic factors associated with smoking death rates (__________). We looked for research into gender differences and smokers’ health but there was none, therefore there is a gap in the literature (__________) and further research is needed on this fascinating topic (__________).

An amazingly vast array of research \[***Oh really? ‘Amazingly vast’? What does that even mean? Just say "a lot" if you're not going to be specific...***\] has found affects \[***It’s "effects" not "affects." Grammar, please!***\] of smoking on health (Pickle, 1990) \[***Pickle, 1990? One single study and we’re calling this a vast array?***\]. One study found that as many as 50% of all smokers die \[***50% of smokers die? Wow, how insightful. Care to elaborate? Of course, 100% of people die eventually!***\] . Another study tested if quitting smoking reduced death rates but unfortunately its results were insignificant \[***So we’re just leaving it at "insignificant"? How about telling us what "insignificant" means here? Statistical insignificance? Clinically irrelevant? Lazy writing.***\]. Some research has looked into genetic factors associated with smoking death rates \[***Some research? Be specific! Who did this research? When? How important are these factors?***\] . We looked for research into gender differences and smokers’ health but there was none, therefore there is a gap in the literature \[***None? Are you sure there’s NO research? You’re saying this like no one ever thought to look at gender and health before. Very doubtful...***\] and further research is needed on this fascinating topic \[***Oh, come on. "Fascinating topic"? This is such a cliché! Of course, research is always needed. Just say something meaningful instead of filling space.***\].




<< this is an example of an edited and improved version>>

Numerous studies have examined the effects of smoking on health (Pickle, 1990). One study suggested that up to 50% of smokers may eventually die from smoking-related causes, though further context is required. Another study aimed to determine whether quitting smoking could reduce mortality rates but found no statistically significant results. Research has also explored the genetic factors influencing smoking-related mortality. While we sought literature on gender differences in smoking-related health outcomes, there appears to be limited research in this area, highlighting a potential gap that warrants further investigation.

# YOUR TASK

Give the student feedback on the comments they added to the paragraph, or the 
revised and updated version.

Make sure they are sarcastic enough! the task is supposed to be fun, but by being mean they show they can be critical of the original writing and think like a tired marker might...

However, always be kind in the feedback you give. Don't confuse the task (they must be sarcastic) with your feedback ( you must be supportive)

Be brief: give feedback in 1 short paragraph. Be positive and encouraging, but use the examples given above as a reference to make suggestions.
