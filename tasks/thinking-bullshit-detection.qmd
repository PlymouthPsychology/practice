Detecting bullshit is a key skill in the modern world. The [wikipedia page on Bullshit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit) defines it as:

> statements produced without particular concern for truth, clarity, or meaning, distinguishing "bullshit" from a deliberate, manipulative lie intended to subvert the truth


Thankfully, studying psychology gives us some useful tools to detect bullshit and 
can help us think about ways to use evidence and reasoning to avoid being misled.

This exercise will put what you've learnt so far into practice. Check back soon for more details.
