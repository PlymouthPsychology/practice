# What are progress meetings for?

XXX TODO this is now for the mid-semester progress meeting

Students often find that the transition from school to university is difficult. This is rarely because the material you study is more complex; most of the time, it is because the *way* you are expected to learn is different, and because *you must take more responsibility for your own learning*.

Progress meetings are regular 'checkpoints' in the year where you can:

-   review what you have done so far, and how successful it has been
-   ask questions about the course, or about the way you are working, and
-   work with your tutor to make plans for the weeks to come

The aim is to provide space to reflect on your progress, and give you the confidence to take responsibility for your own learning.

##  Part 1: Scheduling the meeting

As a [reminder](../progress.html), progress meetings will

-   include your tutor and one other student
-   last around 45 minutes
-   be held face to face in your tutor’s office

## Part 2: Setting the agenda

Before the meeting, it's important to know what you want to get from it.

::: instruction
Part 1

1.  Make a list of 3 things you want to discuss in the meeting (see suggestions below)
2.  Get feedback on your proposed agenda from Psybot

## Part 3: Making good notes

Part 2:

After the meeting, make notes on:

-   what was discussed
-   any actions that were agreed (and a deadline if there is one)

Remember, these notes are important because they will feed into your next progress meeting, and because they will help you to keep track of your progress throughout the year.
