Loneliness is a growing concern among university students worldwide, while problematic social media use has been linked to negative outcomes including poor sleep, low mood, and reduced academic performance. However, few studies have examined how these two issues influence each other over time.
This study investigated whether loneliness and problematic social media use predict each other in Chinese college students and how both develop across one year. A total of 877 students from four universities were recruited, of whom 538 provided valid data across three survey waves. Measures included self-report questionnaires on loneliness, social media use, and demographic factors.
Analyses revealed a bidirectional relationship: loneliness predicted later problematic social media use, and problematic social media use predicted later loneliness. Both increased significantly across the study period, and growth in one variable predicted growth in the other.
These findings suggest a mutually reinforcing cycle between loneliness and problematic social media use at university, highlighting a period of risk. Interventions targeting either factor may help to disrupt this cycle and improve student well-being. Educators, policymakers, and parents should consider ways to reduce loneliness and encourage healthier patterns of online engagement.
