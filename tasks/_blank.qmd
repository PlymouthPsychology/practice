> We love clear, concise writing, like you practiced in the first Writing exercise. In this exercise, we want you to get inside the head of the meanest marker you can imagine. This marker has already marked a big stack of coursework. They are tired and grumpy. They have just picked up an essay that contains some of their pet hates. We’d like you to have some fun expressing their frustration. We would like you to act as a super-critical marker – Professor Perfect - and insert your thoughts about the writing. Professor Snippy has provided an example.


This is the writing that Prof Snippy is marking:

> Since the time of evolution a plethora of research has shown that cows like grass. The first person to research the food preferences of cows was Bloggs (2014), who found that they chose grass more often than baked beans. It is therefore clear that cows like grass.



Prof Snippy has inserted their thoughts while reading it:

> Since the time of evolution [What, has evolution stopped??] a plethora of research [How much is a plethora? Does the quantity matter???] has shown that cows like grass. The first person [I think I read an earlier study... Maybe this was the first one the student has heard of. Should I check??] to research the food preferences of cows was Bloggs (2014), who found that they chose grass more often than baked beans. It is therefore clear [It’s not clear to me... choosing grass doesn’t mean cows like it. Maybe they just don’t like baked beans?] that cows like grass.
