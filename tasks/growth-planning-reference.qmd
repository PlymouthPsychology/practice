# Planning your reference

#TODO: UPDATE THIS TEXT

You need to think about your reference early on in your time at university. You need to plan to make sure your tutor can write you a great reference. Here are some tips to help you plan your reference.

-   First, you need to think about who you want to write your reference. You need to choose someone who knows you well and can write a good reference for you — this will typically be your tutor, but could also be a project supervisor. You need to choose someone who can write about your skills, experience, and achievements.

-   You should think about when you want to ask for your reference. You need to ask for your reference at least a month before you need it. You need to ask for your reference in a polite and professional way (either in person or via email).

-   You need to help the reference-writer do a good job for you! Provide as much information as you can about yourself, your skills, experience, and achievements. You should also provide the reference-writer with a copy of the job description or course you are applying for, and highlight anything you would like them to mention.
