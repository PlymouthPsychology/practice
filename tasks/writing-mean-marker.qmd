> We love clear, concise writing, like you practiced in the first Writing exercise. In this exercise, we want you to get inside the head of the meanest marker you can imagine. This marker has already marked a big stack of coursework. They are tired and grumpy. They have just picked up an essay that contains some of their pet hates. We’d like you to have some fun expressing their frustration. We would like you to act as a super-critical marker – Professor Perfect - and insert your thoughts about the writing. Professor Snippy has provided an example.

This is the writing that Prof Snippy is marking:

> Since the time of evolution a plethora of research has shown that cows like grass. The first person to research the food preferences of cows was Bloggs (2014), who found that they chose grass more often than baked beans. It is therefore clear that cows like grass.

Prof Snippy has inserted their thoughts while reading it:

> Since the time of evolution \[What, has evolution stopped??\] a plethora of research \[How much is a plethora? Does the quantity matter???\] has shown that cows like grass. The first person \[I think I read an earlier study... Maybe this was the first one the student has heard of. Should I check??\] to research the food preferences of cows was Bloggs (2014), who found that they chose grass more often than baked beans. It is therefore clear \[It’s not clear to me... choosing grass doesn’t mean cows like it. Maybe they just don’t like baked beans?\] that cows like grass.

# Overview

\[THE TEXT BELOW COMPRISES THE VIDEO EXPLAINER\]

You have got to university so you are probably pretty good at writing already, but sometimes focusing on new psychology content can distract you from the basics of grammar. It’s upsetting when a student has clearly done lots of research but written it up poorly. I’m often thinking ‘I can guess what they wanted to say but they haven’t actually said it so I can’t give them the marks’.

Hear what some of my colleagues think about writing:

Ben Whalley: "I always feel a little sad when I start reading and essay and see a student who struggles with their writing… on one hand, I want to be able give them the benefit of the doubt and give them credit for the learning they have done. But on the other I know that someone who writes poorly is often hard to distinguish from someone who hasn’t quite grasped the ideas or has mixed them up."

SOMEONE ESLE: “when I’m tired at the end of a long stack of essays it’s hard not to interpret spelling mistakes and grammar errors as a lack of effort… they are so easily caught using Word’s grammar checker or online tools like chatgpt or grammarly that I never quite understand how they slip though”.

ANOD OTNER: “If someone’s applying for a job with me then they must be able to write clearly. If I have to check what they have written and correct it, that’s extra work for me”.

I want you to write clearly and concisely so you can really show off the work that you are going to put into your essays and reports. This task will help you avoid some common mistakes and signpost the different sources of help for improving your writing as you progress through the course.

### Marking students’ work

The sentences below include common mistakes from students’ coursework. Can you explain what the problem with the sentence is and write a correct version that fixes it?

We have done the first one for you. Copy and paste the text below into a document, fill in the blanks, then upload it for feedback from psybot.

<br><br><br><br>

This is an example of an ambiguous sentence that needs to be re-written:

> 1.  The researchers found evidence of life on Mars, they also found pigs on Jupiter.

The problem: The sentence is missing a full stop to separate two different ideas.

Re-written version:

> The researchers found evidence of life on Mars. They also found pigs on Jupiter.
