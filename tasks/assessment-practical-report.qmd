# Formative feedback from PsyBot

PsyBot has been designed To help you improve your work by giving formative feedback before you submit. 

The feedback the system gives is tailored to the assignments you are completing, and PsyBot knows what we expect from stronger or weaker student answers. 

However, the system is not perfect. Please don't rely on the suggestions it makes alone. You need to think for yourself and check your work thoroughly before.

**PsyBot can also make mistakes: if you see something that looks wrong, please check it yourself, or ask one of the TARAs for clarification.**


:::{.instruction}

To get feedback on your report, copy and paste the text of your intro, method, results, and discussion into PsyBot for feedback.

- If your report is a work in progress, add a note to the end and ask PsyBot to focus on specific parts of your report. It can give feedback on those parts only.

- Repeat the process, and improve your report.
