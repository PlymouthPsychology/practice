### What you need to know

This website provides a collection of practice tasks designed to help you develop the skills you need to succeed on the psychology course. 

Tasks are organised by theme and can be completed at your own pace. Some tasks may be recommended by staff during the year when they link with workshop or lecture content.

You'll also find assessment practice tasks that help you work on specific elements of your summative assignments, with opportunities for formative feedback.
